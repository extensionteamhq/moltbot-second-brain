# Daily Journal - February 14, 2026

## Topics Discussed
- Routine heartbeat checks throughout the day
- Trello task monitoring for status changes

## Decisions Made
- No major decisions today - primarily monitoring and maintenance

## Action Items
- Continue monitoring Trello boards for task status changes
- Tasks in progress:
  - **Research:** "Research & Innovate AI Tools for Digital Marketing and Brand Strategy" (Anchor & Staff)
  - **Implementing:** Dirt Roamers Social Media Content Calendar, Content Repurposing Ideas, Second Brain Daily Briefs Section, AI Tools Digest updates

## Key Insights
- Established heartbeat state tracking in `memory/heartbeat-state.json` to detect task status changes between checks
- All tasks remain stable in their respective columns - no movement requiring immediate action

## Summary
A quiet day focused on system maintenance. Conducted regular heartbeat checks to monitor Trello boards for any task status changes. No tasks were moved between columns, indicating Mateo hasn't had a chance to review the current work queue. The implementing column has several items ready for execution once capacity allows.

Happy Valentine's Day! 💕
