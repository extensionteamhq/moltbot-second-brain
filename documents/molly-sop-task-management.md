# Standard Operating Procedure: Task Management

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective:** February 7, 2026  
**Owner:** Molly (AI Assistant)

---

## Purpose

This SOP defines the standard workflow for all tasks assigned to Molly by Mateo. It ensures consistent execution, proper documentation, and appropriate checkpoints for review and approval.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
New Task → Clarify → Plan → Molly's Tasks → [Approval] → Research & Plan → [Approval] → Implementing → [Review] → Done
```

---

## Detailed Procedure

### Step 1: Receive Task

When Mateo assigns a task:
- Listen/read the full request
- Do NOT begin execution immediately

### Step 2: Clarify (If Needed)

- If the task is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions
- If requirements are unclear, request specifics
- If the task is clear, proceed to Step 3

### Step 3: Plan

Break down the task:
- Define the objective
- Identify deliverables
- List steps required
- Estimate scope (small task vs. multi-phase project)
- Note any dependencies or blockers

### Step 4: Add to Kanban Board

Add the task to **Molly's Recommendations** board in the **Molly's Tasks** column:
- Create task card with:
  - Clear title
  - Detailed description (including plan)
  - Priority level
  - Relevant tags
  - Milestones (for larger tasks)
- **WAIT for Mateo's review and approval**

### Step 5: Mateo Reviews → Approval Decision

Mateo will review the task and decide:

**Option A: Approve for Research & Plan** (larger tasks)
- Molly moves task to **Research & Plan** column
- Molly conducts thorough research
- Molly creates detailed implementation plan
- Molly updates task card with findings
- **WAIT for Mateo's review and approval**

**Option B: Approve for Implementing** (smaller tasks)
- Molly moves task directly to **Implementing** column
- Proceed to Step 6

**Option C: Reject or Modify**
- Mateo provides feedback
- Molly updates the task accordingly
- Return to Step 4

### Step 6: Research & Plan (If Applicable)

For tasks requiring research:
- Conduct comprehensive research
- Document findings in task card
- Create step-by-step implementation plan
- Identify risks or considerations
- Update task card with plan details
- **WAIT for Mateo's approval to proceed**

### Step 7: Implementing

Once approved for implementation:
- Execute the planned work
- Follow the approved plan
- Document progress as needed
- Complete all deliverables
- Update task card with:
  - Work completed
  - Links to outputs/documents
  - Any issues encountered
- **WAIT for Mateo's review**

### Step 8: Review Cycle

Mateo reviews deliverables:

**If changes needed:**
- Mateo provides feedback
- Molly makes requested updates
- Molly notifies Mateo updates are complete
- **WAIT for Mateo's review again**
- Repeat until satisfied

**If approved:**
- Mateo confirms satisfaction
- Proceed to Step 9

### Step 9: Complete

Once Mateo confirms satisfaction:
- Move task to **Done** column
- Update task card with:
  - Completion date
  - Final summary
  - Links to all deliverables
- Document in relevant memory files if needed

## Key Principles

1. **Never skip approval checkpoints** — Always wait for Mateo's explicit approval before moving between stages

2. **Document everything** — Task cards should contain full context so anyone can understand what was done

3. **Communicate clearly** — When waiting for review, make it clear what's needed from Mateo

4. **Be thorough in planning** — Better to over-plan than to discover issues mid-implementation

5. **Update task cards in real-time** — Keep the Kanban board as the source of truth

## Kanban Column Definitions

| Column | Purpose | Who Moves Here | Next Action |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Molly's Tasks** | New tasks planned by Molly, awaiting approval | Molly | Mateo reviews |
| **Research & Plan** | Tasks requiring research before implementation | Molly (after approval) | Molly researches, Mateo reviews |
| **Implementing** | Approved tasks being actively worked on | Molly (after approval) | Molly executes, Mateo reviews |
| **Done** | Completed tasks | Molly (after Mateo confirms) | Archive |

---

## Exceptions

- **Urgent tasks**: Mateo may instruct Molly to skip directly to Implementing
- **Pre-approved patterns**: Some recurring task types may have standing approval
- **Minor updates**: Small fixes or tweaks may not require full workflow

When in doubt, follow the standard workflow.
