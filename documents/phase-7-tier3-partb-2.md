Key Metrics:

* Full revenue: Month 10 ($1,000/month)
* Payback period: 11 months from deployment
* 12-month revenue: $3,350
* 24-month revenue: $15,350

Site ROI Analysis
Investment:


* Initial cost: $820
* Monthly costs (8 months pre-revenue): $1,360
* Total investment to revenue: $2,180


Return (assuming site monetized for 4 years):


* Monthly revenue: $1,000
* Monthly variable cost: $170
* Monthly contribution: $830
* Annual contribution: $9,960
* 4-year contribution: $39,840


ROI Calculation:


ROI = (Total Return - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100


ROI = ($39,840 - $2,180) / $2,180 × 100


ROI = 1,727%


Payback Period = $2,180 / $830 = 2.6 months of paid service


                = Month 13 from deployment (10 months to revenue + 2.6 months payback)


Internal Rate of Return (IRR): ~85% annually (exceptional)

CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST (CAC)
CAC Breakdown
Traditional Model (what competitors spend):


* Paid advertising: $500-$1,500
* Sales commission: $200-$500
* Marketing overhead: $100-$300
* Total CAC: $800-$2,300 per client


Our Model (free lead demonstration):


* Paid advertising: $0
* Sales commission: $0 (founder)
* Marketing costs: $0
* Free leads provided: 7-12 leads
* Cash CAC: $0
* Opportunity cost: 7-12 leads × $50 value = $350-$600 (not cash)
* Time investment: ~15 hours @ founder time


Effective CAC: $0 cash outlay


CAC Advantage:


Competitor CAC: $1,500 (average)


Our CAC: $0


Savings per client: $1,500


Savings on 10 clients: $15,000


Savings on 30 clients: $45,000


This savings flows directly to profit margin.


________________


CAC Payback Period
Calculation:


CAC Payback = CAC / Monthly Contribution Margin


Competitor:


$1,500 CAC / $830 margin = 1.8 months


Us:


$0 CAC / $830 margin = 0 months


Our advantage: Immediate positive cash flow from first payment


________________


CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (LTV)
LTV Calculation
Base Assumptions:


* Average monthly fee: $1,000
* Average customer lifespan: 4 years (48 months)
* Monthly churn rate: 2.1% (25% annually)
* Monthly contribution margin: $830 (83%)


LTV Formula:


LTV = Monthly Contribution Margin / Monthly Churn Rate


LTV = $830 / 0.021 = $39,524


Conservative (3 years, 2.8% churn):


LTV = $830 / 0.028 = $29,643


Optimistic (5 years, 1.7% churn):


LTV = $830 / 0.017 = $48,824


Expected LTV: $39,524 (rounded to $40,000)


Alternative Calculation (years-based):


LTV = Monthly Contribution × Average Months


4-year retention:


LTV = $830 × 48 months = $39,840


Matches formula-based calculation ✓


________________


LTV:CAC Ratio
Industry Standards:


* LTV:CAC < 1 = Unsustainable (losing money)
* LTV:CAC = 1-2 = Marginal (barely profitable)
* LTV:CAC = 3 = Minimum acceptable (SaaS standard)
* LTV:CAC = 5+ = Excellent (highly profitable)
* LTV:CAC = 10+ = Exceptional (rare)


Our Ratio:


LTV:CAC = $40,000 / $0 = Infinite


Practical calculation (using opportunity cost):


LTV:CAC = $40,000 / $500 = 80:1


Even accounting for all possible costs (founder time valued at $100/hour):


Time investment: 15 hours × $100 = $1,500


LTV:CAC = $40,000 / $1,500 = 26.7:1


Conclusion: Exceptional unit economics regardless of methodology

COST PER LEAD GENERATED
Lead Economics
Monthly Lead Generation (per site):


* Leads generated: 25 (average, 15-40 range)
* Lead quality: 75% qualified (within service area, real intent)
* Qualified leads: 19 per month


Cost Allocation:


Monthly variable cost per site: $170


Leads generated: 25


Cost per lead = $170 / 25 = $6.80


Cost per qualified lead = $170 / 19 = $8.95


Market Comparison:


* HomeAdvisor cost per lead: $15-$80 (shared with 3-5 contractors)
* Our cost per lead: $6.80 (exclusive to client)
* Client savings: $8.20-$73.20 per lead
* Monthly savings (25 leads): $205-$1,830

Analysis:


* Client pays $1,000, generates $25K-$100K in revenue
* Our fee represents 1-4% of their revenue from our leads
* Even conservative scenario delivers 25:1 ROI for client
* This explains why clients stay (month-to-month despite exceptional value)

Analysis: Margin of safety improves dramatically post-loan, providing substantial cushion against revenue fluctuations.

OPERATING LEVERAGE
Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)
DOL Formula:


DOL = Contribution Margin / Operating Income


At 10 clients:


Contribution Margin = $8,300


Operating Income = $4,085


DOL = $8,300 / $4,085 = 2.03


Interpretation: 1% increase in revenue = 2.03% increase in profit


DOL at Different Scales:


Clients
	Revenue
	Contribution Margin
	Operating Income
	DOL
	7
	$7,000
	$5,810
	$1,595
	3.64
	10
	$10,000
	$8,300
	$4,085
	2.03
	15
	$15,000
	$12,450
	$8,235
	1.51
	20
	$20,000
	$16,600
	$12,385
	1.34
	

Analysis:


* Higher DOL at lower scale (more leverage)
* Lower DOL at higher scale (more stable)
* High fixed costs create operating leverage


Impact of 10% Revenue Change:


Scenario
	Base Revenue
	New Revenue
	Base Profit
	New Profit
	% Profit Change
	10 clients
	$10,000
	$11,000
	$4,085
	$4,915
	+20.3%
	10 clients
	$10,000
	$9,000
	$4,085
	$3,255
	-20.3%
	

Key Insight: Operating leverage cuts both ways. 10% revenue increase = 20% profit increase, but 10% revenue decrease = 20% profit decrease.
