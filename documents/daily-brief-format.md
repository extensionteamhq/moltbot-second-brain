## Section Rules

- **Molly's Task Recommendations:** Only tasks I can do (research, automation, etc.)
- **Molly's Proactive Work:** ONLY include if I actually did proactive work during this period. If I didn't do anything proactive, omit this section entirely. Do NOT create fake proactive work to fill space.

## Separate Calendar Cron Job

**DISABLED** — Calendar is now included in daily brief. No need for separate 7am ET calendar cron job.

---

## Accountability Data Sync

After each accountability check-in (daily at 11pm ET):
1. Copy accountability JSON to Second Brain: `cp ~/clawd/memory/accountability/YYYY-MM-DD.json ~/clawd/projects/second-brain/data/accountability/`
2. Git add, commit, and push to Second Brain

This keeps the accountability grid page up to date.
