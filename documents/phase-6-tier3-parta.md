Summary Months 13-18:

* Monthly cash flow: $4,085 → $6,575
* Cumulative cash: Positive from Month 13 onward

* Loan fully repaid: Month 18 ✓
* DSCR Month 18: 2.80x


________________




18-Month Summary (Expected Scenario):


* Total revenue: $90,000
* Total operating expenses: $10,800 ($600 × 18)
* Total variable expenses: $26,010
* Total loan payments: $65,070
* Total expenses: $101,880
* Net loss (18 months): ($11,880)
* Ending cash position: $27,110 ($60K loan - $11,880 loss - $21K operating capital used)


However: Business is now profitable ($6,575/month cash flow) with valuable assets (13 sites worth $325K-$455K at 25-35x monthly revenue).

Conservative Scenario
Key Differences from Expected:


* Time to rank: 9 months (vs. 6 months)
* First revenue: Month 12 (vs. Month 8)
* Close rate: 60% (vs. 70%)
* Average pricing: $900/month (vs. $1,000)
* Month 18 revenue: $8,000 (vs. $13,000)

Implications:

* Business still viable but tighter margins
* Month 19+ cash flow positive at $2,790/month
* Recovery timeline: 2-3 additional months to rebuild reserves
