# The StoryBrand Framework

Donald Miller's StoryBrand framework positions the **customer as the hero** and your **business as the guide**.

## The 7-Part Framework

1. **A Character** — Your customer is the hero, not your brand
2. **Has a Problem** — External, internal, and philosophical problems
3. **Meets a Guide** — You! Show empathy + authority
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan** — Simple 3-step process
5. **Calls Them to Action** — Direct CTA + transitional CTAs
6. **That Helps Them Avoid Failure** — Paint the stakes
7. **And Ends in Success** — Show the transformation

## Key Principles

- **Clarify your message** — If you confuse, you lose
- **Talk about their problem** more than your solution
- **Position yourself as the guide** — Guides have been there before
- **Create a one-liner** that passes the "grunt test"

## Application to Dirt Roamers

- **Hero**: Landowner stuck with unwanted property
- **Problem**: Can't sell, taxes piling up, no buyers
- **Guide**: We buy land fast, no hassle
- **Plan**: 1) Tell us about your land → 2) Get cash offer → 3) Close in days
- **CTA**: Get Your Cash Offer Today
- **Failure**: Property sits, taxes accumulate, stress continues
- **Success**: Cash in hand, problem solved, move on with life
