## Topics Discussed

### Dirt Roamers Research Deep Dive
Extensive overnight research session produced 5 comprehensive analysis files for the land investing business:

- **Land Portal** — All-in-one platform by Apke brothers ($60-500/mo). Built-in skip tracing, AI comp reports, MLS data. Strong recommendation to start 7-day trial on Advanced plan.
- **Land AI** — Premium done-for-you AI cold calling service (~$2-5K/mo). Best saved for scaling phase when doing 2-3+ deals/month consistently.
- **County Records** — Evaluated ATTOM, Regrid, PropMix, TaxNetUSA. Conclusion: use aggregators like Land Portal for now, enterprise APIs later.
- **Skip Tracing** — Compared 6+ services. Land Portal built-in ($0.04-0.08) or Skip Force ($0.06-0.09) are best options.
- **Growth Markets** — Free Census ACS + BLS data for market analysis. Tennessee Valley Corridor showing +32% growth since 2020.

### Market Intelligence (Morning Brief)
- **Real Estate:** Government shutdown affecting HUD, FHA loan delays possible. Housing market "finding its footing" after volatility.
- **AI/Tech:** Safety report warns of deepfakes, cloud stocks down ~20% YTD, AI infrastructure spending could hit $1.4 trillion in 2026.
- **Insight:** Shutdown delays make cash offers more attractive to motivated sellers — opportunity for Dirt Roamers.

### Second Brain Development
Created comprehensive email sequences using Chris Voss negotiation techniques:
- **Cold Email Sequence:** 16 emails over a full year for reaching cold land owners
- **Nurture Email Sequence:** 13 emails for re-engaging "not now" leads
- **Kanban Board:** New project management feature with drag-and-drop, priorities, tags

### Technical Issues
- Google Calendar credentials expired — needs re-authorization for partnerwithmateo calendar

## Decisions Made

1. **Land Portal is the top contender** — Should replace both landinsights.co AND land.id as primary sourcing tool
2. **Land AI is premature** — Table until consistent deal flow (Phase 4 of business plan)
3. **Tennessee is priority market #1** — Best fundamentals of all target states (no income tax, strong migration inflow)
4. **Target market priority order:** TN → NC → GA → SC → FL → AL → MT
5. **Use Chris Voss techniques** for all land seller outreach — tactical empathy, labeling, no-oriented questions

## Action Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Start Land Portal 7-day trial (Advanced plan, $99.95/mo)
- [ ] Test Land Portal on AL, GA, TN target counties
- [ ] Re-authorize Google Calendar for daily briefs
- [ ] Compare Land Portal data quality vs current landinsights

### Research & Planning
- [ ] Set up Census ACS tracking spreadsheet for target markets
- [ ] Create Google Alerts for "[County] + development" in priority areas
- [ ] Review and customize cold email sequence for GoHighLevel

### Content
- [ ] Record 60-second video: "Why cash offers win during government shutdowns"
- [ ] Set up GoHighLevel workflows for email sequence automation

## Key Insights

1. **Tool consolidation opportunity** — Land Portal could replace 2 tools while adding features (MLS data, AI comps, education)

2. **Migration data is gold** — Tennessee Valley Corridor +32% since 2020, Charlotte 2-hour radius +25% annually. These are the growth corridors to target.

3. **The hybrid approach wins** — Land AI's success comes from human-dialed + AI qualification + human QA. Pure automation isn't there yet.

4. **Cost per deal perspective** — One land flip profit covers 6-12 months of tool costs. Investment in the right tools pays for itself quickly.

5. **Chris Voss in land deals** — "It seems like the timing just isn't right" beats "Are you ready to sell?" — labeling and accusation audits open doors.

## Summary

Productive day focused on Dirt Roamers infrastructure. The overnight research session delivered actionable intelligence: Land Portal emerges as the clear tool upgrade path, Tennessee is the priority market, and the email sequences are ready for deployment. Calendar integration needs a quick fix. Main blocker now is executing: start that Land Portal trial and get campaigns running in TN target counties.
