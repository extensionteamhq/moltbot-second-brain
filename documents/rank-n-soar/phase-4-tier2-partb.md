TIER 2: MANAGEMENT & OPERATIONS LEVEL (CONTINUED)
________________


PAGE 10: MARKETING & SALES STRATEGY
CLIENT ACQUISITION PROCESS
Overview: The Free Lead Demonstration Method
Our customer acquisition strategy eliminates traditional sales resistance by proving value before asking for payment. This zero-cost acquisition model (CAC = $0 cash outlay) achieves 70% close rates compared to industry standard 20-30% for cold outreach.


Total Timeline: 6-10 weeks from first contact to paying client Cost: Founder time only (no advertising, no paid lead generation) Expected Close Rate: 70% after free lead demonstration phase


________________


Step 1: Site Ranking & Lead Generation (Months 4-6 post-launch)
Activity: Website achieves page 1 rankings and begins generating organic leads


Key Metrics:


* Target keywords ranking positions 1-5 (top of page 1)
* 15-40 qualified leads per month (varies by niche and market size)
* Website traffic: 200-800 visitors per month
* Conversion rate: 5-10% (visitors to leads)


Quality Indicators:


* Leads include specific service request details
* Contact information provided (phone, email, address)
* Geographic location within target service area
* Urgency indicators (timeline, project scope)


Decision Point: Once site generates consistent 15+ leads monthly for 2-3 consecutive weeks, move to Step 2.


________________


Step 2: Qualified Provider Research (Week 1)
Activity: Identify 3-5 ideal local service providers who would benefit from our leads


Research Checklist:


1. Google Search & Review Analysis


   * Search "[service] [city]" and analyze top 10 local results
   * Review Google Business Profile listings
   * Check star ratings (target: 4.5+ stars)
   * Read reviews for quality indicators (professionalism, responsiveness, quality)
   * Review count (minimum 20+ reviews preferred)


2. Website & Online Presence Evaluation


   * Professional website or lack thereof
   * Current web presence quality (good = harder sell, poor = easier sell)
   * Social media activity (Facebook, Instagram)
   * Evidence of digital marketing sophistication


3. Business Verification


   * License verification (state contractor board lookup)
   * Insurance confirmation (if publicly available)
   * Better Business Bureau rating (if listed)
   * Years in business (prefer 3+ years established)
   * Service area coverage (matches our lead geography)


4. Capacity Assessment


   * Team size indicators (website, reviews mentioning crew)
   * Response to review volume (can they handle current demand?)
   * Seasonal considerations (busy vs. slow season)
   * Growth indicators (hiring notices, fleet expansion)


5. Red Flag Screening


   * Poor reviews or unresolved complaints
   * License issues or legal problems
   * Unprofessional communication in responses
   * Price-only focus (no quality emphasis)
   * Reputation concerns


Output: Ranked list of 3-5 qualified prospects prioritized by fit quality


Time Investment: 2-3 hours per market/niche

Step 3: Initial Outreach (Week 1-2)
Objective: Make contact with decision maker and secure permission to send first free lead


Contact Method Hierarchy:


1. Phone call (preferred - highest response rate)
2. Email (if phone unsuccessful after 3 attempts)
3. Facebook message (if other methods fail)
4. In-person visit (last resort, only if local)


Phone Script (Conversational, not salesy):


"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I came across your company 


while researching deck builders in Spartanburg, and I noticed 


you have excellent reviews.


I've built a website that generates leads for deck builders 


in your area, and it's currently generating 20-30 leads per 


month. I'm looking for the right contractor to work with.


I'd like to send you a lead completely free - no strings 


attached - just to see if it's a good fit. Would you be 


interested in receiving a free deck building lead?"


[PAUSE - Listen to response]


[If yes]: "Great! What's the best way to send it to you - 


email, text, or phone call?"


[If hesitant]: "I understand you might be skeptical. That's 


exactly why I don't charge anything up front. I want to prove 


the quality first. What do you have to lose from one free lead?"


[If no capacity]: "I appreciate your honesty. Would you be 


open to me checking back in [timeframe] when things slow down?"


Email Approach (if phone doesn't connect):


Subject: Free deck building lead for [Company Name]


Body:

I found your company while researching top-rated deck builders 


in Spartanburg. Your 4.8-star rating and customer reviews 


impressed me.


I've built a website that generates qualified leads for deck 


builders in your service area. It's currently producing 20-30 


leads monthly, and I'm looking for the right contractor partner.


I'd like to send you a lead completely free - no cost, no 


commitment, no strings attached. Just to demonstrate the quality.


Interested? Reply with the best way to send it (email, phone, text).


Best regards,


[Your Name]


[Phone Number]


P.S. This is a real lead from a homeowner looking for deck 


installation in your area. I'll send it whether you're interested 


in more or not - no obligation either way.


Success Metrics:


* Contact rate: 80%+ (reach decision maker)
* Interest rate: 60%+ (willing to receive free lead)
* Timing: 3-5 business days to secure permission from 3-5 prospects

________________


Step 5: First Lead Follow-Up (Week 2-3)
Objective: Gather feedback, build relationship, demonstrate care about results


Follow-Up with Contractor (3 days after delivery):


Phone Call Script:


"Hi [Name], it's [Your Name]. I wanted to check in on that 


deck lead I sent you last week. Were you able to connect 


with [Customer Name]?


[Listen to response]


[If yes, positive]: "That's great! Are you moving forward 


with a quote/estimate? ... Excellent. This is exactly the 


kind of quality lead the site generates consistently."


[If yes, but didn't close]: "I appreciate the feedback. Can 


you tell me what the issue was? ... [Listen]. That helps me 


understand what to look for in future leads."


[If no contact yet]: "No problem. Sometimes it takes a few 


tries to connect. Let me know if you'd like me to follow up 


with them to encourage them to call you back."


How would you rate the lead quality on a scale of 1-10?


Follow-Up with Customer (5-7 days after delivery):


Purpose: Verify contractor contacted them, assess service quality, gather testimonial


Brief Phone Call or Email:


"Hi [Customer Name], this is [Your Name] from [Website Name].


I connected you with [Contractor Name] for your deck project


last week. I wanted to make sure they reached out to you.


Did [Contractor] contact you? ... How was your experience 


with them? ... Are you moving forward with the project?


[If positive]: Would you mind if I use your feedback as a 


testimonial? I can keep it anonymous if you prefer.


[If negative]: I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like me to 


connect you with a different deck builder?


Documentation:


* Record feedback in CRM
* Note conversion status (quote given, job booked, passed, etc.)
* Save testimonials (contractor and customer)
* Identify any issues to improve future lead quality


Time Investment: 30-45 minutes total (both follow-ups)


________________


Step 6: Extended Free Lead Phase (Weeks 3-10)
Objective: Build trust and demonstrate consistent value over time through continued free lead delivery


Delivery Cadence:


* Send 1-2 additional leads per week
* Total free leads: 6-12 over 4-8 week period
* Spacing: Don't overwhelm (allow time to work each lead)


Lead Selection Strategy:


* Mix of urgency levels (immediate, 1-3 months out, flexible)
* Variety of project sizes (small repairs to full new construction)
* Geographic spread within service area
* Demonstrate lead quality consistency


Ongoing Communication:


* After each lead: Brief email with lead details
* Weekly check-in: Quick text or email asking how leads are converting
* Bi-weekly call: 10-15 minute conversation about results, feedback, relationship building


Relationship Building Topics:


* Their business challenges and goals
* Seasonal patterns in their industry
* Capacity and growth plans
* Other marketing channels they use (or tried)
* Why they got into the business (build personal connection)
* Family, hobbies, interests (humanize the relationship)


Value Demonstration Tracking:


Create simple spreadsheet shared with contractor:


Lead #
	Date
	Customer Name
	Project Value
	Status
	Outcome
	1
	12/15
	John Smith
	$10K
	Quote Given
	Pending
	2
	12/18
	Jane Doe
	$8K
	Job Booked
	Won ✓
	3
	12/22
	Bob Jones
	$15K
	Quote Given
	Pending
	

Calculate and Share ROI:


After 6-8 free leads with 2-3 jobs booked:


"Hey [Contractor], just wanted to recap what we've done 


together over the past 2 months:


- Leads delivered: 8


- Jobs quoted: 6


- Jobs booked: 2-3


- Total project value: $18,000-$25,000


- Your revenue from our leads: $18K-25K


- Your cost: $0


When we transition to paid service at $1,000/month, you're 


already seeing 18-25x return on investment. Make sense to 


continue?"


Success Indicators (ready to close sale):


* Contractor responds quickly to each new lead
* Provides feedback without prompting
* Asks questions about continuing relationship
* Mentions us to their customers or in reviews
* Has closed at least 1-2 jobs from our leads
* Expresses appreciation or satisfaction


Time Investment: 2-3 hours per week per active prospect


________________


Step 7: Sales Close (Weeks 8-10)
Objective: Convert free lead relationship into paying monthly client


Timing Indicators (when to close):


* ✓ Delivered 6-12 free leads
* ✓ Contractor closed 1-3 jobs (or has strong pipeline)
* ✓ Positive feedback on lead quality
* ✓ Established rapport and trust
* ✓ Contractor has capacity for more work
* ✓ 6-8 weeks of relationship building


Closing Conversation (Phone call, relaxed tone):


"Hi [Name], I wanted to talk about transitioning our 


arrangement to a paid partnership.


Over the past [X] weeks, I've sent you [Y] leads, and you've 


booked [Z] jobs worth approximately $[Amount]. The site is 


consistently generating 20-30 leads monthly.


Here's what I'm proposing:


$1,000 per month, month-to-month (you can cancel anytime)


For that, you get:


- Continued exclusive leads (same quality you've seen)


- Monthly performance reports


- Ongoing SEO and site optimization


- Priority support


No long-term contract. If the leads stop being valuable, 


just let me know and we'll stop. But based on what we've 


done together, I think this will be a great partnership.


Make sense to move forward?"


[PAUSE - Let them process]


[Objection handling below if needed]


[If yes]: "Great! I'll send over a simple service agreement 


today. We can start [next month/immediately] and I'll set 


up billing. Same lead quality, just now we're official partners."


Common Objections & Responses:


Objection 1: "That seems expensive."


Response:


"I understand. Let's look at the math together. You've closed 


[X] jobs totaling $[Y] from our leads. That's [$Y ÷ months] 


per month in revenue. Our fee is $1,000/month. That's a 


[calculate ratio] return on investment.


Compare that to HomeAdvisor where you'd pay $50-80 per lead 


and share it with 4 other contractors. You'd spend $1,000-2,400 


monthly for shared leads. Or Google Ads where you might spend 


$2,000-5,000 monthly with uncertain results.


This is actually the most cost-effective lead source available, 


and you've already proven it works."


Objection 2: "I need to think about it."


Response:


"Absolutely, take your time. What specific concerns do you 


have? ... [Address concerns] ... 


Remember, there's no long-term commitment. Try it for a month 


or two. If it's not working, cancel anytime. You've already 


seen the quality - this just continues what we've been doing.


How about this: Let's start next month. That gives you a few 


weeks to think it through, and you can see a few more leads 


in the meantime. Sound fair?"


Objection 3: "I'm already getting enough work."


Response:


"That's great! I'm glad business is strong. A few thoughts:


1) Busy season doesn't last forever. This builds a consistent 


   pipeline for slow months.


2) You can be more selective on jobs when you have steady leads.


   Pick the best projects, charge premium prices.


3) If you grow your team, you'll need consistent work to keep 


   them busy.


Would it make sense to continue at least through [slow season]? 


You can always pause during your busiest months if needed."


Objection 4: "Can you do $500/month instead?"


Response:


"I appreciate you want to negotiate, but here's the challenge: 


The site costs me $[actual costs] monthly to maintain and 


optimize, plus my time for ongoing SEO and client support.


At $1,000/month, you're getting 20-30 leads worth $1,000-$1,500 


in market value (at $50/lead). If I drop to $500, I literally 


lose money on the relationship.


What I can do: Let's start at $1,000 for 3 months. If the lead 


volume or quality drops, we can revisit pricing. But I need to 


maintain the quality you've seen, and that requires proper investment.


Fair enough?"


Close Rate Expectations:


* After full free lead demonstration: 70%
* After partial demonstration (3-5 leads): 50%
* Cold pitch without free leads: 10-20% (not our method)


Time Investment: 1-2 hours for closing conversation and agreement setup

PRICING STRATEGY & JUSTIFICATION
Value-Based Pricing Model
Not Cost-Plus Pricing (our costs + markup) Instead: Value-Based (what client receives in return)


Client Value Calculation:


* Leads received: 20-30 per month (average 25)
* Market rate per lead: $50 (conservative for home services)
* Total lead value: $1,250/month
* Our price: $1,000/month
* Client saves: $250/month vs. buying leads individually


Plus Additional Value:


* Exclusive leads (no competition): +$500/month value
* Professional website (virtual asset): +$300/month value
* Ongoing SEO (continued ranking): +$500/month value
* Monthly reporting (business insights): +$100/month value
* Total value delivered: ~$2,650/month
* Price charged: $1,000/month
* Value ratio: 2.65:1


________________


Pricing Tiers Rationale
Why Tiered Pricing:


1. Market size correlates with lead volume: Larger markets = more searches = more leads
2. Competitive intensity varies: Tier 1 markets harder to rank (more effort/cost)
3. Client revenue potential: Larger markets = higher job values = more budget for leads
4. Pricing psychology: Clients understand "big city premium"


Tier Justification:


Tier
	Market Size
	Monthly Fee
	Lead Volume
	Cost/Lead
	Ranking Difficulty
	Tier 3
	25K-50K
	$800
	15-20
	$40-53
	Easy (3-4 months)
	Tier 2
	50K-200K
	$1,000
	20-30
	$33-50
	Medium (4-6 months)
	Tier 1
	200K+
	$1,500
	30-50
	$30-50
	Hard (6-9 months)
	

Pricing Flexibility:


* Start at tier pricing
* Adjust based on actual lead volume after 3 months
* Can increase if delivering 40+ leads consistently
* Can decrease if market underperforms (rare, but fair)

Churn Management
Early Warning Signs:


* Payment delays or issues
* Reduced responsiveness to leads
* Negative feedback on lead quality
* Complaints about volume
* Mentions of budget tightening
* Seasonal slowdown without heads-up


Retention Intervention:


1. Proactive outreach: "Noticed [issue], wanted to check in..."
2. Problem-solving: "What can we do to make this work better for you?"
3. Temporary solutions: Pause during slow season, resume later
4. Price adjustment: Rare, but consider if genuinely struggling
5. Graceful exit: If truly not working, part on good terms (potential referral source)


Target Churn Rate: 2.1% monthly (23% annually)


* Lose 2-3 clients per year at 10-client scale
* Must replace with 2-3 new clients annually
* Net growth requires exceeding replacement rate
