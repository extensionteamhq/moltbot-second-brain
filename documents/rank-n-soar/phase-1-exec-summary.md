﻿RANK & RENT BUSINESS PLAN
Executive Summary
________________


THE OPPORTUNITY
A proven entrepreneur with 24 years of web development experience and 10+ years in professional SEO seeks $60,000 in private money lending to launch a rank-and-rent website business generating recurring monthly revenue from local service providers.


The Model: Build SEO-optimized websites for high-value home services (deck building, foundation repair, window replacement, etc.), rank them in Google search results, then rent these lead-generating assets to qualified local contractors on a month-to-month subscription basis.


The Edge: Unlike competitors using outdated WordPress technology, this business leverages modern web architecture (Next.js, Vercel) for superior performance, combined with proven marketing frameworks (StoryBrand, Russell Brunson, Dan Kennedy) and a zero-cost customer acquisition strategy.

BUSINESS MODEL FUNDAMENTALS
Revenue Model: Month-to-month subscriptions averaging $1,000/client


* Small markets (under 50K population): $800/month
* Medium markets (50K-200K population): $1,000/month
* Large markets (200K+ population): $1,500/month
* No long-term contracts initially - continuous value demonstration builds retention


Unit Economics (per client):


* Customer Acquisition Cost: $0 (free lead demonstration strategy)
* Gross Margin: 83% (minimal variable costs once sites rank)
* Customer Lifetime Value: $36,000-$60,000 (3-5 year retention)
* LTV:CAC Ratio: Infinite (effectively 60:1 when factoring time investment)
* Monthly Revenue per Site: $1,000
* Monthly Variable Cost per Site: $170 (SEO maintenance)
* Monthly Contribution Margin: $830 per client


Break-Even Analysis: 5.1 clients at full pricing covers all fixed costs and loan payment


Profitability at Scale:


* 10 clients = $8,300 gross profit - $4,215 fixed costs = $4,085/month operating profit (41% margin)
* 20 clients = $16,600 gross profit - $4,215 fixed costs = $12,385/month operating profit (62% margin)

6. Diversified Portfolio: 10+ sites across multiple niches and markets reduces risk compared to single-site operators.


7. Asset-Backed Value: Ranked websites have intrinsic resale value - comparable sites sell for 25-35x monthly revenue ($25,000-$35,000 per site at $1,000/month).

RISK MITIGATION
Primary Risks & Mitigations:


Risk
	Mitigation Strategy
	Google Algorithm Changes
	White-hat SEO only, technical best practices, diversified across 10+ sites, eventual PPC supplementation
	Ranking Timeline Delays
	Conservative 6-month assumption (industry average 3-6 months), $10K emergency reserve, portfolio approach spreads risk
	Lead Quality Issues
	Proven marketing frameworks for pre-qualification, continuous optimization, client feedback loops
	Client Churn
	Month-to-month demonstrates confidence, high-quality lead delivery, relationship building during free trial, multiple upsell paths
	Competition
	First-mover advantage in selected niches, superior technical implementation, 24-year expertise advantage
	

Conservative Financial Modeling: All projections use pessimistic assumptions - 6-month ranking timeline (could be 3-4 months), 70% close rates (could be 80%+), 4-year LTV (often longer), gradual revenue ramp (immediate full price possible).

This is digital real estate with tenants pre-qualified through free demonstrations. The foundation is solid. The execution plan is clear. The operator is proven. The opportunity is now.
