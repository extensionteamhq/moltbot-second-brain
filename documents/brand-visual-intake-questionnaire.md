# Brand Visual Style Guide
## Client Intake Questionnaire

Complete this questionnaire so we can build a comprehensive Brand Visual Style Guide tailored to your company.

---

### What to have ready before you start:

- Your current logo files, if you have them (all versions)
- Any existing brand colors, fonts, or style references
- 3–5 screenshots or links to designs you love (from any brand)
- 2–3 examples of designs that feel wrong for your brand
- Photos or images you've used in marketing (if applicable)

This questionnaire works whether you have an established brand or are starting from scratch. Just answer what applies to you.

**The more detail you provide, the sharper your guide will be.**

---

## Part 1: Brand Foundation

Before we design anything, we need to understand who you are. Visual identity should reinforce strategy—not just look pretty.

### Q1. Company name (exactly as it should appear in all materials):

---

### Q2. Give us the short version: What does your company do, who do you serve, and what makes you different?

2–3 sentences is fine. We need enough context to make visual choices that reinforce your positioning. A designer who knows you serve "rugged outdoor enthusiasts" will make very different choices than one designing for "luxury wellness retreats."

---

### Q3. What is your company's mission, vision, and core values?

If you have these written down already, paste them here. If not, a rough version is fine—we'll refine.

**Mission (why you exist):**

**Vision (where you're headed):**

**Core values (3–5):**

### Q4. If you have a completed Brand Voice Style Guide, please attach it or summarize your brand personality here.

If you've already defined your brand personality traits, archetype, and character—share them. The visual identity should align with the voice. If you haven't done this yet, describe your brand's personality in 3–5 adjectives (e.g., rugged, warm, modern, trustworthy, playful).

> **Note:** We recommend completing the [Brand Voice Style Guide](/?doc=anchor-staff-guide-brand-voice) first, as it informs visual design decisions.

---

### Q5. What 2–3 visual principles should guide every design decision for your brand?

These are the "rules of thumb" for your visual identity. Examples: "Clarity over complexity," "Professional yet approachable," "Bold and unapologetic," "Clean and minimal," "Warm and handcrafted."

3.

## Part 2: Logo & Identity Mark

We need to understand your current logo situation—whether you have one you love, one that needs work, or need one created.

### Q6. What is your current logo situation? (Check one)

- [ ] I have a professional logo I'm happy with
- [ ] I have a logo but it needs refinement or updated variations
- [ ] I have something but it's not professionally designed
- [ ] I don't have a logo yet — it needs to be created

> ⚠️ If you checked "I don't have a logo yet," skip ahead to Q9. We'll use your answers there to inform the logo direction. Q7 and Q8 are for clients with existing logos only.

---

### For clients WITH an existing logo:

### Q7. What logo file formats do you currently have? (Check all that apply)

If you're not sure what formats you have, that's okay—just share all the logo files you have and we'll assess.

- [ ] Vector files (.SVG, .AI, .EPS) — scalable, for print and professional use
- [ ] High-resolution PNG (.PNG with transparent background)
- [ ] JPEG (.JPG) — standard image format
- [ ] PDF containing the logo
- [ ] I only have the logo on my website / social media
- [ ] I'm not sure what I have

### Q8. What logo variations do you currently have? (Check all that apply)

- [ ] Full color version (on light backgrounds)
- [ ] Full color version (on dark backgrounds)
- [ ] All-black (one-color) version
- [ ] All-white (reversed) version
- [ ] Icon / mark only (no text)
- [ ] Horizontal layout
- [ ] Stacked / vertical layout
- [ ] Social media profile version (square crop)
- [ ] Favicon (tiny browser tab icon)
- [ ] I only have one version of the logo

> ⚠️ If you don't have all of these variations, that's expected — the style guide will specify which ones need to be created.

---

### For ALL clients:

### Q9. Describe your logo (or describe the logo you want created).

**If you have a logo:** What does it look like? What do the elements represent? Is it a wordmark (just text), an icon + text, an abstract symbol, an illustrated mark? Are there elements that are particularly meaningful?

**If you need a logo created:** What imagery, symbols, or concepts should it draw from? What feeling should it evoke? Are there any elements that must be included (e.g., an icon that represents your industry)?

- [ ] I'm describing an EXISTING logo
- [ ] I'm describing a logo that NEEDS TO BE CREATED

---

### Q10. Is there anything about your current logo you want to change—or specific things you want to avoid in a new logo?

**If you have a logo:** What's working? What isn't? Anything you'd change if you could?

**If you need a new logo:** What styles or approaches do you NOT want? (e.g., "no clip-art look," "no script fonts," "nothing too corporate")

---

## Part 3: Color Palette

Colors are one of the most powerful brand recognition tools. Whether you have established colors or need a palette built from scratch, we'll define the full system.

### Q11. What is your current color situation? (Check one)

- [ ] I have established brand colors with defined values (HEX, RGB, etc.)
- [ ] I use certain colors but they're not formally defined (no exact codes)
- [ ] I have a general sense of the colors I want but nothing established
- [ ] I'm starting from scratch — I need a full color palette developed

### Q12. If you have existing colors, list them below. If you don't have colors yet, skip to Q14.

Share whatever you have: HEX codes (#1A56DB), RGB values, Pantone numbers, or even just the color names. If you only know "the blue from our website," that works too—we'll extract the exact values.

**Primary color(s):**

**Secondary color(s):**

**Any other colors used:**

### Q13. How do you feel about your current colors?

- [ ] **Love them** — Keep everything and just formalize the palette
- [ ] **Mostly good** — Keep the core colors but open to refining or expanding
- [ ] **Neutral** — They're fine but I'm open to changes if something better fits
- [ ] **Not great** — I'd like to explore new directions

### Q14. What mood or feeling should your colors evoke?

Whether you're keeping existing colors or starting fresh, this tells us if the palette is aligned with the right emotional tone. Check all that apply.

- [ ] Trustworthy and professional (blues, navy, grays)

**Additional thoughts on color mood or direction:**

---

### Q15. Are there any colors you absolutely do NOT want associated with your brand?

- [ ] I have a general idea of the type style I want but no specific fonts chosen
- [ ] I'm starting from scratch — I need font recommendations

### Q18. If you have existing fonts, list them below. If you need recommendations, skip to Q20.

List the font names and where they're used (headlines, body text, etc.). If you're not sure of the exact names, tell us where to look (your website, a Canva template, etc.) and we'll identify them.

**Heading font:**

**Body text font:**

**Any other fonts used:**

**Source (Google Fonts, Adobe, purchased, etc.):**

- [ ] Not sure — I'll share brands I admire and you can recommend

### Q21. Font licensing: what's your preference? (Check one)

Free fonts (Google Fonts) are great for web and accessible to anyone on your team. Paid fonts (Adobe, commercial foundries) offer more unique options but require licenses.

- [ ] Free / open source only (Google Fonts, etc.)
- [ ] We have Adobe Creative Cloud (so Adobe Fonts are available)
- [ ] Open to purchasing commercial fonts if they're the right fit
- [ ] No preference — recommend what works best

## Part 5: Imagery & Photography

The photos, illustrations, and graphics you use are just as important as your logo and colors. This section defines the visual tone—whether you have a library of images already or are just getting started.

### Q22. What role does (or will) photography play in your brand? (Check one)

- [ ] **Central** — Photos are (or will be) a core part of our marketing

### Q28. Does your brand use (or would you like to use) any patterns, textures, or graphic motifs?

---

## Part 7: Visual References & Inspiration

Show us what you love, what you don't, and what inspires you. This is one of the most valuable sections of the entire questionnaire.

### Q32. Share 3–5 brands, websites, or designs whose visual style you admire.

These don't have to be in your industry. We're looking for the aesthetic qualities that resonate with you. For each, tell us WHAT specifically you like (the colors? the typography? the layout? the photography? the overall vibe?). Include URLs or brand names.

**Brand/Design 1:**
**What I like about it:**

**Brand/Design 2:**
**What I like about it:**

**Brand/Design 3:**
**What I like about it:**

**Brand/Design 4:**
**What I like about it:**

**Brand/Design 5:**
**What I like about it:**

### Q33. Share 2–3 designs or visual styles that feel completely WRONG for your brand.

Anti-examples help us as much as inspiration. What makes you cringe? What's the visual equivalent of nails on a chalkboard for your brand? Tell us what specifically doesn't work.

**Anti-example 1:**
**What feels wrong:**

**Anti-example 2:**
**What feels wrong:**

**Anti-example 3:**
**What feels wrong:**

### Q34. Are there any specific design trends you love or hate right now?

**Trends I love:**

**Trends I hate:**

## Part 8: Applications & Deliverables

Help us understand where your brand identity currently lives (or will live) so we can tailor the style guide to your real-world needs.

### Q35. Where does (or will) your brand identity show up? (Check all that apply)

Check both what you're doing today and what you plan to add. This ensures the style guide covers everything you need now and in the near future.

- [ ] Website
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Social media (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.)
- [ ] Email campaigns

### Q36. Are there any new applications you're planning to add in the next 6–12 months?

---

### Q37. Who will be creating designs and materials using this style guide? (Check all that apply)

This helps us determine how detailed and prescriptive the guide needs to be. Non-designers need more guardrails and templates; experienced designers need more flexibility and technical specs.

- [ ] Freelance designers or agencies
- [ ] Marketing team members (not professional designers)
- [ ] Founders / leadership team
- [ ] Virtual assistants or offshore team
- [ ] Print vendors or signage companies
- [ ] Web developers
- [ ] Anyone on the team (using templates in Canva, etc.)
- [ ] Other: ________________________________

---

## Part 9: Asset Management

A style guide is only useful if people can find and use the assets. Let's plan how your brand files will be organized and accessed.

### Q38. How are your brand assets currently organized? (Check one)

Be honest—even if the answer is "they're not." Understanding the current state helps us build a system that actually works for your team.

- [ ] Well-organized — We have a structured folder system with clear naming (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- [ ] Somewhat organized — Assets are in a shared drive but there's no consistent structure
- [ ] Scattered — Files are spread across multiple places, hard to find
- [ ] On someone's computer — No shared access
- [ ] We don't have brand assets yet — This will be our starting point
- [ ] We use a brand management tool (Brandfolder, Frontify, etc.)

### Q39. Where would you like brand assets to live going forward?

If you're happy with your current setup, say so. If you want to migrate to something new, let us know. We'll include the recommended folder structure and file naming conventions in the style guide.

---

## Part 10: Anything Else

### Q40. Is there anything else we should know about your brand's visual identity, your design preferences, or specific challenges you're facing?

Anything that didn't fit neatly into the questions above. Industry-specific considerations, accessibility requirements, multi-language needs, co-branding situations, or anything that keeps your designs from feeling consistent.

---

### Q41. What is the single most important thing you want people to FEEL when they see your brand's visual identity?

One word or one sentence. This becomes the north star for every visual decision.

---

**Thank you for completing this questionnaire.**

Your answers are the foundation of a visual identity that looks like you, works across every touchpoint, and connects with your customers.

**Don't forget to attach:**
- All current logo files (if you have them)
- Any existing brand guidelines or assets
- Screenshots or links to visual inspiration (Q32–34)
- Photos or images you've used in marketing

We'll use this to build your complete Brand Visual Style Guide.

---

> **Next Step:** Once completed, use these answers to create the [Brand Visual Style Guide](/?doc=anchor-staff-guide-brand-visual).
