# Daily Journal - February 1, 2026

## Topics Discussed

- **Second Brain App** — Added new document types (newsletters, scripts, ideas, concepts) and fixed mobile responsiveness
- **Accountability Tracking** — Set up tracking system for workout and morning reading habits
- **Cron Reliability** — Investigated issues with scheduled tasks not executing properly

## Decisions Made

- Document types finalized: journal, notes, newsletters, scripts, ideas, concepts
- Mobile layout uses slide-out sidebar with hamburger menu
- Accountability logs stored in `memory/accountability/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

## Action Items

- [ ] Verify morning brief cron fires tomorrow at 11:00 UTC
- [ ] Review and merge Second Brain PR
- [ ] Check SubTo coaching calendar for upcoming sessions
- [ ] Record short-form video content

## Key Insights

> "The gap between knowing and doing is larger than the gap between ignorance and knowledge." — Consistency beats intensity.

> Mobile-first design matters — if the app doesn't work on phone, it doesn't work.

## Summary

Productive day focused on tooling and systems. Second Brain app now has all document types and proper mobile support. Accountability tracking is live. Main challenge: scheduled tasks need more reliable execution — investigating root cause.
