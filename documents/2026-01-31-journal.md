# Daily Journal - January 31, 2026

## 📌 Topics Discussed

- Second Brain app development (like Alex Finn's setup)
- Codex CLI quota limits and OpenAI API usage
- Auto-generating journal entries from chat conversations
- Setting up daily cron jobs for automation

## ✅ Decisions Made

- Built Second Brain app directly after Codex hit quota limits
- Set up daily cron job at 3 AM UTC (10 PM Eastern) for journal generation
- Using markdown files with frontmatter for document storage
- Auto-tagging system: journal, notes, newsletters, scripts, ideas

## 🎯 Action Items

- [ ] Deploy Second Brain app to Vercel
- [ ] Check OpenAI usage dashboard for quota status
- [ ] Consider raising OpenAI spending cap if needed
- [ ] Add more sample documents to Second Brain

## 💡 Key Insights

> The Codex CLI "Quota exceeded" error means either rate limits (resets quickly) or spending caps (adjust in OpenAI dashboard) were hit.

> Second Brain architecture: Drop `.md` files in `documents/` folder with frontmatter, and the UI auto-discovers them — simple and flexible.

> Cron jobs in Clawdbot use `systemEvent` payload kind with text prompts, not direct message payloads.

## 📝 Summary

Today we built out the Second Brain app infrastructure. Started with Codex CLI but hit OpenAI quota limits partway through — completed the build directly. The app is a Next.js 16 app with an Obsidian/Linear-inspired dark mode UI, featuring:

- Sidebar with search and tag filtering
- Markdown viewer with syntax highlighting
- Auto-detection of `.md` files in the documents folder
- Frontmatter-based metadata (title, tags, date)

Also set up the auto-journal system: a TypeScript generator script and a daily cron job that triggers at 10 PM Eastern. The cron reviews the day's conversations and creates a structured journal entry with topics, decisions, action items, and insights.

**Files created:**
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/projects/second-brain/` — Full Next.js app
- `scripts/generate-journal.ts` — Journal generator module
- `scripts/daily-journal.sh` — Shell script for manual triggers
