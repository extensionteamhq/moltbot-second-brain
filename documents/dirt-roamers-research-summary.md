## Executive Summary

### Land Portal — Strong Recommendation ⭐
- **Best alternative to landinsights.co** for land-specific data
- $99.95/mo (Advanced) gets MLS data + AI comp reports + skip tracing
- **30% lifetime recurring affiliate commissions** available
- Founded by active land investors (Apke brothers)
- **Action:** Start 7-day free trial, apply for affiliate program

### Land AI — Evaluate Later 💰
- Fully managed AI cold calling service (not DIY software)
- Claims 5× better than traditional cold calling
- Pricing not public — need to book a call
- **Likely expensive** — better for when deal flow is proven
- **Action:** Table for Phase 4+, after GoHighLevel + lead gen is running

### Skip Tracing — Land Portal Wins
- If using Land Portal, their built-in skip tracing is most cost-effective ($0.04-0.05/record)
- For standalone: **BatchSkipTracing** ($0.20/record) or **123skip.com** ($0.07/record) for budget
- PropStream skip tracing ($0.12/record) is overpriced

### County Records — Use Platform Data
- Don't need direct county access for most use cases
- Land Portal / PropStream aggregate this data

### Buyer Financing Strategies 💰
*Added Feb 12, 2026*

**Seller financing = sell at 100-120% MV + collect 8-12% interest**

Key to making this work safely:

**Optimal Structure:**
| Component | Recommended | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Down Payment | 20-30% | Buyer has skin in game, covers your costs |
| Interest Rate | 10% | Standard for land, justified vs banks |
| Amortization | 20-25 years | Lower payments = more buyers |
| Balloon | 3-7 years | Limits exposure, forces refinance/sale |

**Document Types:**
- **Land Contract** (smaller deals): You keep title until paid off, easier to reclaim
- **Deed of Trust** (larger deals): Buyer gets title, you get lien + power of sale

**Protection Checklist:**
✅ 20-30% down minimum
✅ Balloon payment (3-7 years)
✅ Power of sale clause (non-judicial foreclosure)
✅ Insurance requirement (you as loss payee)
✅ Due-on-sale clause
✅ Property tax verification annually

**Example Deal:**
- Buy 20 acres for $80K (financed at 80% = $64K note)
- Sell for $120K with 25% down = $30K
- Finance $90K at 11%, 7-year balloon
- Monthly: $866 income - $520 to your seller = **$346/mo net**
- Balloon year 7: Collect $82K, pay off $35K = **$47K net**
- **Total profit: ~$90K on $16K invested**

**State foreclosure timelines (Mateo's markets):**
- GA: ~45 days (fastest)
- AL, TN: ~90 days
- MT, NC: ~120-150 days
- FL, SC: 6-12 months (judicial)

**When to use:** Buyer can't get bank financing, you can command 100-120% MV, and higher total return justifies longer exit.
