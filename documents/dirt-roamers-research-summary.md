## Executive Summary

### Land Portal — Strong Recommendation ⭐
- **Best alternative to landinsights.co** for land-specific data
- $99.95/mo (Advanced) gets MLS data + AI comp reports + skip tracing
- **30% lifetime recurring affiliate commissions** available
- Founded by active land investors (Apke brothers)
- **Action:** Start 7-day free trial, apply for affiliate program

### Land AI — Evaluate Later 💰
- Fully managed AI cold calling service (not DIY software)
- Claims 5× better than traditional cold calling
- Pricing not public — need to book a call
- **Likely expensive** — better for when deal flow is proven
- **Action:** Table for Phase 4+, after GoHighLevel + lead gen is running

### Skip Tracing — Land Portal Wins
- If using Land Portal, their built-in skip tracing is most cost-effective ($0.04-0.05/record)
- For standalone: **BatchSkipTracing** ($0.20/record) or **123skip.com** ($0.07/record) for budget
- PropStream skip tracing ($0.12/record) is overpriced

### County Records — Use Platform Data
- Don't need direct county access for most use cases
- Land Portal / PropStream aggregate this data
- Direct county lookups for specific deal due diligence
- ATTOM/BatchData APIs only if building custom tools later

### Growth Market Data — Free Stack Available
- **U.S. Census** — Population/migration (free)
- **Zillow Research** — Housing trends (free)
- **Redfin Data Center** — Weekly market pulse (free)
- **IRS Migration Data** — County flows (free)
