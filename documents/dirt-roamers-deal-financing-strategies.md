## Funding Model Comparison

| Model | Capital Required | Profit Share | Best For |
|-------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Equity/JV** | $0 | 50-80% to you | Scaling, no capital |
| **Transactional** | $0 | 95-100% (minus fee) | Double closes |
| **Hard Money** | 30-50% down | 100% (minus interest) | Confident flippers |
| **Self-Fund** | 100% | 100% | Maximum profit |
| **Seller Finance** | 10-20% down | 100% | Creative deals |

---

## Equity/JV Funding Partners

Equity partners fund 100% of the deal in exchange for a profit split. You bring the deal; they bring the capital.

### Top JV Funders for Land Investors (2026)

| Funder | Profit Split | Deal Size | Approval | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Serious Land Capital** | 70% to you (<$100K) | $20K-$500K+ | 24-48 hrs | Self-funded, #1 rated |
| **Parcel Funders** | 70% to you (<$75K) | $5K-$1M | 24 hrs | Loyalty program |
| **Freedom Land Capital** | 70% after 20% fee | $30K-$120K | 24-48 hrs | Long-term partnerships |
| **Partner with Pete** | 50/50 | $10K+ | 24-48 hrs | Turnkey (handles all ops) |
| **Finance Land Sales** | 80% (<30 days) | Varies | 24 hrs | Time-based sliding scale |
| **Northgate Land Capital** | 70% (<60 days) | Varies | 24-48 hrs | Sliding scale |
| **Liberty Land Group** | 60% | $5K-$50K | Varies | Smaller deals |

### How JV Profit Splits Work

Most JV funders use a **sliding scale** based on how quickly you sell:

**Example: Northgate Land Capital**
| Sale Timeframe | Your Share | Funder's Share |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| 0-60 days | 70% | 30% |
| 61-120 days | 60% | 40% |
| 121-180 days | 50% | 50% |
| 181-364 days | 40% | 60% |
| 365+ days | 0% | 100% |

**Key Insight:** The faster you flip, the more you keep. JV partners incentivize quick sales.

### JV Funding Requirements

Most equity funders require:

- Purchase price ≤ 50-55% of market value
- Clear marketable features (no "odd" deals)
- Legal access to property
- Reasonable sale timeline (under 12 months)
- You handle marketing and sales (unless turnkey)

3. **Turnkey** — They handle marketing/sales too

**Fee Structure:**

| 0-2 days | Transactional | 97% (3% fee or $3K min) |

---

## Transactional Funding

Short-term funding (hours to days) for **double closes** where you buy and resell the same day.

### How It Works

1. You get property under contract (A-B)
2. You find end buyer (B-C)
3. Transactional funder wires funds to close A-B
4. Same day: B-C closes and funds pay off A-B + fees
5. You keep the spread

### Transactional Funding Rates

| Funder | Days 1-2 | Days 3+ | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Parcel Funders** | 3% or $3K (whichever greater) | +1%/day | No credit check |
| **Finance Land Sales** | 5% | +1 point/day | Fast approval |
| **General Market** | 2-4% | +1-2%/day | Varies by lender |

### When to Use Transactional Funding

✅ **Use when:**
- Spread is under $10K (assignment isn't appealing)
- Seller won't allow assignment
- You want to hide your profit from seller/buyer
- Same-day close is feasible

❌ **Avoid when:**
- Closings can't happen same day
- Fees eat too much profit
- Simple assignment works

---

## Debt Funding (Hard Money)

Borrow against the property, keep 100% of profits minus interest.

### Top Debt Funder: All Terrain Capital

**Specialty:** Fastest debt funding for land flippers

| Loan Size | Approval | LTV | Terms |
|-----------|----------|-----|-------|
| $10K-$50K | Same day | ≤50% | Interest accrues until sale |
| $50K+ | 2-3 days | ≤50% | Requires comps, financials |

**How It Works:**
- No monthly payments (interest accrues)
- If you don't sell in 180 days: You're in default
- Deed-in-lieu option: Transfer property to resolve debt

**Best For:** Experienced flippers with high-confidence deals who want 100% of profits.

### Traditional Hard Money for Land

Most hard money lenders **avoid vacant land** because:
- No income stream
- Harder to value
- Less liquid than houses

**If you find a land hard money lender:**
- Expect 60-75% LTV (you need 25-40% down)
- Rates: 12-15%+ annually
- Points: 2-4 upfront
- Term: 6-12 months

### EquityMax — Vacant Land Specialist

**Website:** [equitymax.com/acreage-vacant-land](https://equitymax.com/acreage-vacant-land)

- Specializes in acreage and vacant land
- 48-hour closing possible
- Nationwide coverage

---

## Self-Funding Strategies

Keep 100% of profits by funding deals yourself.

### 1. Cash Reserves

The simplest approach—use your own capital.

**Target:** 3-6 months of deal capital
- If average deal is $30K → Keep $90K-$180K liquid

### 2. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)

Tap your primary residence equity for deal capital.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Low interest (7-10%) | Puts your home at risk |
| Revolving credit | Requires equity |
| No per-deal approval | Takes 30-45 days to set up |

**Best For:** Investors with significant home equity who want cheap capital.

### 3. Business Line of Credit

Unsecured or secured line for operating capital.

| Type | Typical Limit | Rate |
|------|---------------|------|
| Unsecured | $10K-$100K | 12-20% |
| Secured (collateral) | $50K-$500K | 8-15% |

**Requirements:** 2+ years in business, good credit, demonstrated revenue.

### 4. 0% APR Credit Cards

Short-term capital for small deals.

- Many cards offer 15-21 months 0% APR on purchases
- Balance transfer offers for existing debt
- Risk: Reverts to 20%+ APR after promo period

**Use Carefully:** Only for deals you can flip within promo period.

### 5. Self-Directed IRA/401k

Use retirement funds for real estate investment.

| Option | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Self-Directed IRA | Custodian holds funds, you direct investments |
| Solo 401k | More control, can lend to yourself |
| ROBS | Roll retirement into active business (complex) |

**Key Rules:**
- Profits go back into retirement account (tax-deferred)
- Can't use property personally
- Requires specialized custodian

### 6. Private Money (Friends & Family)

Raise capital from your network.

**Structure Options:**
- Fixed return: 8-12% annually
- Profit share: 20-30% of profits
- Equity stake: Partial ownership

**Important:** Always have written agreements, even with family.

## Decision Framework

### When to Use Each Funding Type

| Scenario | Best Option |
|----------|-------------|
| Starting out, no capital | JV partner (Parcel Funders, Serious Land) |
| Quick flip, same-day close | Transactional funding |
| High-confidence deal, want 100% profit | Debt funding or self-fund |
| Building track record | JV partner (learn with their money) |
| Scaling rapidly | Mix of JV + debt |
| Subdivision or development | JV for larger capital needs |

### Profit Comparison Example

**Deal:** Buy $40K, Sell $80K ($40K gross profit)

| Funding Type | Your Capital | Fees/Split | Your Net Profit |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Self-fund** | $40K | $0 | $40,000 (100%) |
| **Hard Money** | $16K (40% down) | ~$4K interest | $36,000 (90%) |
| **JV (70/30)** | $0 | 30% split | $28,000 (70%) |
| **JV (50/50)** | $0 | 50% split | $20,000 (50%) |
| **Transactional** | $0 | ~$3K fee | $37,000 (93%) |

**Key Insight:** JV funding gives you the lowest per-deal profit BUT allows you to do unlimited deals without capital constraints. 

**Example Math:**
- Self-fund 2 deals/year ($40K capital) = $80K profit
- JV-fund 10 deals/year ($0 capital) = $280K profit

Volume often beats margin when scaling.
