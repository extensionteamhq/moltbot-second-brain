# Probate Lead Sourcing Strategies for Land Investors

*Created: February 21, 2026*

---

## Overview

Probate leads are one of the most valuable lead sources for land investors. When landowners pass away, heirs and executors are often highly motivated to sell—they want to liquidate assets, settle debts, or simply cash out properties they have no attachment to. This guide covers how to source probate leads for land deals specifically.

## Why Probate Leads Work for Land

### Seller Motivation

Probate sellers are among the most motivated in real estate:

| Motivation Factor | Why It Matters |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Emotional detachment** | Heirs often have no connection to inherited land |
| **Financial pressure** | Estate debts, taxes, maintenance costs add up |
| **Distance** | Heirs may live far from the property |
| **Time constraints** | Courts set deadlines for estate settlement |
| **Multiple heirs** | Siblings prefer cash split over shared ownership |
| **No use for property** | Raw land has no income stream for heirs |

### Land-Specific Advantages

Vacant land in probate is particularly attractive:

- **Lower emotional attachment** than a family home
- **No tenants** or occupancy complications
- **Simpler due diligence** than improved properties
- **Often overlooked** by investors focused on houses
- **Less competition** for land-focused probate leads

### Ideal Probate Land Profiles

Based on Dirt Roamers target criteria, prioritize:

- Parcels 5-50 acres in AL, FL, GA, MT, NC, SC, TN
- Properties owned 10+ years by the decedent
- Land without structures (vacant/raw)
- Parcels in growth areas outside metros
- Properties with tax liens or delinquent taxes

## Probate Timeline & Best Practices

### Understanding the Probate Process

| Phase | Typical Duration | What's Happening |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Filing** | Week 1-4 | Petition filed with court |
| **Appointment** | Month 1-2 | Executor/administrator named |
| **Inventory** | Month 2-4 | Assets identified, appraised |
| **Creditor Period** | Month 3-7 | Debts claimed and paid |
| **Distribution** | Month 6-12+ | Assets distributed to heirs |

### Best Contact Windows

- **Inventory Phase (Month 2-4):** Executor is cataloging assets, aware of property
- **Post-Creditor (Month 6+):** Most debts settled, ready to liquidate
- **Extended Probate (12+ months):** Frustrated, very motivated

### State-Specific Considerations

**Dirt Roamers Target States:**

| State | Probate Type | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Alabama** | Supervised/Independent | 6-12 months | Larger estates get supervised |
| **Florida** | Formal/Summary | 6-12 months | Summary for estates <$75K |
| **Georgia** | Solemn Form | 4-12 months | No independent administration |
| **Montana** | Informal/Formal | 4-8 months | Informal is faster |
| **North Carolina** | Independent/Supervised | 4-12 months | Most use independent |
| **South Carolina** | Supervised | 8-12 months | All probate supervised |
| **Tennessee** | Supervised | 6-12 months | Standard supervision |

### Lead Scoring for Probate

| Factor | Points | Rationale |

| Target county | +10 | Primary markets |
| Filed 60+ days ago | +10 | More likely ready |
| Multiple heirs | +5 | Often want cash split |
| Out-of-state executor | +10 | Distance = motivation |
