# Daily Journal - February 6, 2026 (Friday)

## Topics Discussed

### Dirt Roamers Research Deep Dive
Continued comprehensive research during overnight cron job, building on the foundation from Feb 5th. All research is being compiled in the `projects/dirt-roamers/research/` directory.

**Key areas covered:**
- Land Portal evaluation and pricing breakdown
- Land AI cold calling service assessment
- Skip tracing vendor comparison
- County records data sources
- Growth market analysis across target states

## Decisions Made

1. **Land Portal is the recommended primary platform**
   - $99.95/month Advanced tier offers best value
   - Includes MLS data, AI comp reports, and competitive skip tracing
   - 30% lifetime recurring affiliate commission available

2. **Land AI deferred to later phase**
   - Pricing is premium (likely $2-5K/month)
   - Better suited once deal flow hits 2-3 deals/month consistently

3. **Skip tracing approach finalized**
   - Use Land Portal built-in ($0.04-0.05/record) as primary
   - BatchSkipTracing as backup for standalone bulk needs

4. **County records strategy**
   - Platform-aggregated data sufficient for lead gen
   - Direct county lookups reserved for deal due diligence only

## Action Items

- [ ] Start Land Portal free trial
- [ ] Apply for Land Portal affiliate program
- [ ] Set up GoHighLevel CRM
- [ ] Select first target county (recommendations: Polk FL or Cherokee GA)
- [ ] Create market tracking spreadsheet using free Census/BLS data

## Key Insights

1. **Affiliate opportunity with Land Portal is significant** - 30% lifetime recurring commissions means recommending tools Mateo already uses can generate passive income through Dirt Roamers Resources.

2. **Tennessee Valley Corridor showing strongest growth** - +32% population growth since 2020 makes TN a priority market, followed by NC, GA, SC, FL, AL, and MT.

3. **Free data sources are underutilized** - Census ACS, BLS, Zillow Research, Redfin Data Center, and IRS migration data provide robust market intelligence at no cost.

4. **Platform consolidation saves money** - Land Portal could potentially replace both landinsights.co and land.id subscriptions while adding more features.

## Summary

February 6th was primarily an automated research day, with the overnight cron job completing deep-dive analysis of Dirt Roamers tooling options. The research validated Land Portal as the clear frontrunner for an all-in-one land investing platform, with strong affiliate potential for Dirt Roamers Resources. Growth market analysis confirmed Tennessee as the priority state, with a clear framework established for evaluating and ranking target counties.

The business plan has been updated with research task completions, refined tool recommendations, and updated affiliate opportunities. Next concrete steps are to begin the Land Portal trial and set up GoHighLevel to start building the marketing infrastructure.

No direct conversations with Mateo today - this was a quiet day focused on background automation and research compilation.
