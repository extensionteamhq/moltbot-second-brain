# Dirt Roamers Nurture Email Sequence

**Goal:** Re-engage landowners who previously said "not right now" and convert when timing is right  
**Audience:** Warm leads — we've spoken before, they weren't ready to sell at that time  
**Tone:** Chris Voss negotiation style — patient, empathetic, friendly neighbor vibe  
**Cadence:** Day 90 after "not now," then every 30 days for a full year

---

## Context

These folks already know who we are. They've talked to us. They said some version of "not interested right now" or "maybe later." Our job is to stay top of mind without being annoying — so when their situation changes, we're the first call they make.

## Email 1 — Day 90: The Respectful Check-In

**Subject:** Checking in (no pressure)

Hey [First Name],

It's Mateo from Dirt Roamers. We chatted a few months back about your [County] property, and you mentioned the timing wasn't right.

I totally get it — and I'm not here to push. Just wanted to check in and see how things are going.

If anything's changed or you've had any new thoughts about the land, I'm here. If not, no worries at all. I just wanted to keep the door open.

Hope you're doing well.

Talk soon,

## Email 2 — Day 120: The Labeling Follow-Up

**Subject:** It sounds like you're in a good spot

Hi [First Name],

When we talked, it sounded like you were in a good place with your property — no urgency, no pressing need to sell. And honestly, that's a great position to be in.

But I've learned that things can shift quickly. A tax bill, a family situation, or just a change in priorities can turn "maybe someday" into "let's do this now."

If that happens for you, I'd love to be your first call. We've already talked, so you know we're real people — not some corporate machine.

Just wanted to plant that seed. No pressure.

Take care,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 3 — Day 150: The Story Email

**Subject:** Made me think of you

Hey [First Name],

Quick story: I just closed a deal with a landowner who told me "not now" about eight months ago. Last month, he called out of the blue — turns out he decided to retire early and wanted to simplify.

We closed in two weeks. He's now fishing in Florida.

Point is: "not now" doesn't mean "never." And when his timing changed, he remembered our conversation.

I'm not saying your situation is the same. But it made me think of you and our chat about your [County] property.

If anything shifts, you know where to find me.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 4 — Day 180: The Halfway Mark

**Subject:** 6 months since we talked

Hi [First Name],

Can you believe it's been six months since our conversation? Time moves fast.

I wanted to reach out — not to pitch you, but just to stay connected. You were kind enough to chat with me before, and I appreciate that.

If selling has crossed your mind at all, I'd love to hear what you're thinking. Even if it's just "I'm curious what it would be worth now" — that's a totally valid starting point.

No pressure. Just keeping the lines open.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Warmly,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 5 — Day 210: The Empathy Check

**Subject:** Still the right decision?

Hey [First Name],

When we talked, you decided to hold onto your property — and that made sense at the time.

I'm curious: does it still feel like the right decision?

Sometimes we make choices and they stay right. Other times, life changes and so does the math. Either way, I'm not here to second-guess you — just genuinely curious how you're feeling about it now.

If you want to chat, I'm here. If not, no worries.

Take care,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 6 — Day 240: The Value Reminder

**Subject:** Quick thought on your property

Hi [First Name],

I've been keeping an eye on the market in [County], and I wanted to share something: land values have been [shifting/holding steady/climbing] lately.

I know you weren't ready to sell when we talked, but market timing can matter. If you've ever wondered "what could I actually get for this?" — I'm happy to give you an honest assessment. No strings attached.

Just let me know. Or don't. I'll keep checking in either way.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 7 — Day 270: The Tax Angle

**Subject:** Tax season coming up

Hey [First Name],

With tax season on the horizon, I always think about landowners like you — holding property, paying taxes year after year, maybe wondering if it's worth it.

If you've ever done that mental math ("How many more years of taxes before this doesn't make sense?"), I get it. It's a real question.

If you want to explore options, I'm here. We can talk numbers, timeline, whatever would be helpful. No commitment, just a conversation.

Let me know if you're open to it.

Take care,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 8 — Day 300: The Calibrated Question

**Subject:** What would change your mind?

Hi [First Name],

I've been thinking about our conversation, and I'm curious about something.

When you said the timing wasn't right — what would need to change for it to be right?

I'm not asking to argue or convince you. I'm genuinely trying to understand. Is it price? Timing? Life circumstances? Something else entirely?

If you're open to sharing, I'd love to hear. It helps me understand what matters to you.

Either way, appreciate your time.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 9 — Day 330: The Family Consideration

**Subject:** Thinking about the future

Hey [First Name],

One thing I've learned doing this: land often outlives our plans for it.

Folks hold onto property thinking they'll build, or pass it down, or figure it out later. And sometimes "later" just keeps getting pushed back.

I'm not saying that's you. But if you've ever thought about what happens to that land down the road — whether it becomes a gift or a burden for someone else — it might be worth having a conversation now.

Just something to think about. I'm here if you want to talk it through.

Warmly,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 10 — Day 360: The Year Mark

**Subject:** A full year later

Hi [First Name],

It's been about a year since we first talked about your property in [County]. A lot can happen in a year.

I've stayed in touch because I believe timing matters — and I've seen plenty of people go from "not now" to "let's do this" when their circumstances change.

So here I am, checking in one more time: has anything shifted for you?

If so, let's talk. If not, I'll keep reaching out every now and then — just to stay connected.

Thanks for being patient with me over the past year.

All the best,  
**Mateo & [Wife's Name]**

## Email 11 — Day 390: The Fresh Start

**Subject:** New year, same offer

Hey [First Name],

New year, fresh start — figured I'd reach out again.

Our conversation about your [County] property is still on my mind. If selling has become more appealing (or if you're just curious what the market looks like now), I'm here.

No pressure. Just wanted you to know the door's still open.

Hope the new year is treating you well.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 12 — Day 420: The Light Touch

**Subject:** Still here

Hi [First Name],

Just a quick note: I'm still here if you ever want to revisit our conversation about your land.

No update needed. Just keeping the connection alive.

Take care,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 13 — Day 450: The Final Nurture

**Subject:** Last scheduled check-in

Hey [First Name],

This is my last scheduled email to you — I don't want to overstay my welcome in your inbox.

But I want you to know: if you ever decide to sell that [County] property, I hope you'll reach out. We had a real conversation, and I'd love to be the one to help when the time is right.

Until then, wishing you and your family all the best. It's been good staying in touch.

Take care,

## Key Principles for Nurture Sequence

### 1. Respect the Relationship
They've already talked to us. They know we're real. Don't start over — build on what exists.

### 2. Acknowledge Their Decision
They said "not now" for a reason. Honor that. Don't make them feel like they made a mistake.

### 3. Plant Seeds, Don't Push
Every email should offer value or spark a thought — not pressure them into a decision.

### 4. Chris Voss Techniques
- **Labeling**: "It sounds like you're in a good spot..."
- **Calibrated Questions**: "What would need to change?"
- **Tactical Empathy**: Acknowledge their perspective before presenting yours
- **No-Oriented Questions**: "Would it be crazy to..." (use sparingly in nurture)

### 5. Stay Human
Remember: we're Mateo and [Wife's Name], not a corporation. Every email should sound like a friend checking in, not a sales machine grinding.

### 6. Make Responding Easy
Always give them a simple way to re-engage: reply, text, or call. Remove friction.
