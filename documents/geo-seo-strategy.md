# GEO - Generative Engine Optimization

The new frontier beyond traditional SEO.

## What is GEO?

People are increasingly asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude for recommendations instead of Googling. GEO is about optimizing content to appear in AI-generated answers.

## Key Differences from SEO

| Traditional SEO | GEO |
|----------------|-----|
| Keywords | Topical authority |
| Backlinks | Citations in training data |
| Meta tags | Clear, structured content |
| SERP ranking | AI answer inclusion |

## Winning Strategies

1. **Comprehensive, expert-level content** - AI favors authoritative sources
2. **Structured answers** - Direct Q&A format works well
3. **Consistent NAP** - Name, Address, Phone across the web
4. **Get cited** - Mentions from authoritative sources matter

## Prediction

By end of 2026, 30%+ of B2B buying research will start in an AI chat, not Google.

## Relevance to Projects

- **Rank-n-Soar** - Should factor in LLM SEO from day one
- **mrmateomoore.com** - Position as authority for AI to cite
