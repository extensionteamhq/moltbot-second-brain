# Building Your Land Buyer List

*Created: February 16, 2026*

---

## Why Your Buyer List Is Everything

The #1 predictor of success in land flipping: **how fast you can sell**.

A strong buyer list means:
- Faster closings (days, not months)
- Higher prices (competitive buyers)
- Less marketing spend (direct outreach)
- Repeat business (investors buy multiple times)

**Goal:** Build a qualified list of 25-50 active buyers BEFORE you have deals to sell.

---

## Types of Land Buyers

### Tier 1: Active Investors (Your VIPs)

| Buyer Type | Characteristics | Buying Pattern |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Land flippers** | Buy cheap, sell retail | 5-20 parcels/year |
| **Developers** | Buy for subdivision/building | High volume, specific areas |
| **Builders** | Need lots for new construction | Consistent demand |
| **Hedge funds/LLCs** | Institutional buyers | Large volume, quick close |

**These buyers:**
- Close fast (often cash)
- Buy repeatedly
- Refer other buyers
- Pay wholesale prices (but reliably)

### Tier 2: End Users

| Buyer Type | Characteristics | Buying Pattern |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Dream home builders** | Want land to build on | One-time, emotional |
| **Recreational buyers** | Hunting, camping, retreat | Seasonal, price-sensitive |
| **Homesteaders** | Self-sufficient living | Specific requirements |
| **Neighbors** | Expand existing property | Highest prices, slow |

**These buyers:**
- Pay retail or above
- Take longer to close
- Often need financing (seller finance opportunity)
- One-time purchases

### Tier 3: Opportunistic

| Buyer Type | Characteristics | Buying Pattern |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **"Pickup truck investors"** | Mom-and-pop flippers | Occasional, local |
| **Speculators** | Buy and hold for appreciation | Slow, patient |
| **Tax buyers** | Look for tax deed opportunities | Niche, specific |

2. Filter: "Lead Type" → Cash Buyers
3. Filter: "Property Type" → Vacant Land
4. Filter: "Owner Type" → Businesses (LLCs, Corps)

**Gold mine feature:** Click any buyer to see ALL properties they own nationwide. If they own 100+ land parcels, they're a serious buyer.

**Cost:** ~$99/month

### 2. County Recorder / Assessor Records

**What:** Public records of all property sales

**How to use:**
1. Go to county assessor website or visit office
2. Search deed transfers for last 12 months
3. Filter for vacant land sales
4. Extract buyer names/entities
5. Skip trace for contact info

**Pro tip:** Look for repeat buyers (same LLC name appearing multiple times)

**Cost:** Free to cheap

### 3. Facebook Groups

**Best groups for land buyers:**
- "Land Investors" (largest)
- "Vacant Land Investing"
- "[State] Land Investors" (state-specific)
- "Raw Land Flipping"
- "Creative Finance for Real Estate"

**Strategy:**
1. Join groups, be active (not spammy)
2. When you have a deal, post: "Just locked up [X] acres in [County], looking for buyer. DM for details"
3. Collect contact info from everyone who responds
4. Add to buyer list (even if they don't buy this one)

**Cost:** Free

### 4. Land Listing Platforms (Reverse Search)

**Where:**
- LandWatch
- Lands of America
- Land.com
- Zillow Lots/Land

**How to use:**
1. Search for SOLD listings in your market
2. Note the agents/companies selling
3. Contact them: "I wholesale land in [area], want to be notified of my deals?"
4. Agents often have buyer lists themselves

**Cost:** Free

### 5. BiggerPockets Forums

**Strategy:**
1. Post in "Land Investing" or "Wholesaling" forums
2. Share market insights (builds credibility)
3. When you have deals, post: "Deal Alert: [brief details]"
4. Collect interested parties

**Bonus:** Connect with investors in specific markets through marketplace posts

**Cost:** Free (or Pro membership ~$390/year for more features)

### 6. Builder Outreach

**Who to target:**
- National builders: DR Horton, Lennar, KB Home, Meritage
- Regional builders in your market
- Custom home builders (Google "[city] custom home builder")

**How to reach:**
1. Google "[builder name] land acquisition"
2. Find the land acquisition manager or purchasing director
3. Email/call: "I source land deals in [market]. Can I send you my inventory when I have deals?"

**Sample outreach:**
```
Subject: Land acquisition opportunities in [County]

Hi [Name],

I work with land owners in [County] who are looking to sell. I noticed [Builder] is active in the area.

Do you have a land acquisition team I could connect with when deals come across my desk?

I typically see [X-acre residential lots / infill parcels / etc.] and can send details when I have inventory.

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Cost:** Free (just time)

### 7. REIA Meetings (Real Estate Investor Associations)

**Strategy:**
1. Find local REIA in your market (Google "[city] real estate investor association")
2. Attend meetings regularly
3. Network with: flippers, wholesalers, buy-and-hold investors
4. Collect cards, add to CRM, follow up

**What to say:**
"I focus on land deals in [area]. When I find good ones, I'd love to send them your way. What are you looking for?"

**Cost:** $100-300/year membership

### 8. Direct Mail to Land Owners (Neighbor Strategy)

**How it works:**
1. When you get a property under contract
2. Pull list of all adjacent landowners
3. Send postcard: "Your neighbor's property is for sale. Interested in expanding?"

**Why it works:** Neighbors pay premium prices (consolidation, privacy, access)

**Cost:** $0.50-1.50/piece

### 9. Craigslist & Facebook Marketplace

**Two strategies:**

**A) Post your deals**
- List properties in "Real Estate for Sale"
- Include: location, size, price, contact method
- Collect all inquiries (even non-buyers become leads)

**B) Respond to "Looking for land" posts**
- Search "looking for land" or "want to buy land"
- Reach out: "I source land in this area. What are you looking for?"
- Add to buyer list

**Cost:** Free

### 10. Your Existing Deals (Snowball Effect)

**Every deal generates more buyers:**
- Buyer who purchased → ask for referrals
- Buyers who inquired but didn't buy → keep on list
- Agents involved → add to list
- Title company contacts → often know active buyers

**Ask after every closing:**
"Do you know anyone else looking for land in this area? I often find good deals."

## Buyer Qualification Process

### Questions to Ask Every Potential Buyer

1. **What areas are you buying in?** (County/state specific)
2. **What size parcels?** (5-10 acres, 20+ acres, etc.)
3. **What's your typical budget per deal?** (Qualifying)
4. **How do you fund deals?** (Cash, hard money, seller finance)
5. **How quickly can you close?** (Days or weeks = serious)
6. **How many deals do you do per year?** (Volume buyer vs. one-time)
7. **What's a deal-breaker for you?** (Access issues, utilities, etc.)

### Scoring Your Buyers

| Score | Criteria | Priority |
|-------|----------|----------|
| A-Buyer | Cash, closes in 14 days, 5+ deals/year | Send deals first |
| B-Buyer | Cash or financing, 30-day close, 2-5 deals/year | Second wave |
| C-Buyer | Slower close, specific requirements, 1-2 deals/year | Nurture |

**Focus on building A and B buyers first.**

- Add appropriate tags

**Day 1:** Send "what we do" email
```
Subject: How we work together

Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Here's how I operate:

Does that look right? Reply with any updates.

When a deal hits, I'll send basic info. If you're interested, I'll share full details. Simple.

Talk soon,
[Your name]
```

### Weekly Deal Blast

## Buyer List Metrics

### Track These Numbers

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Total buyers | 100+ | Volume |
| A-buyers | 10-15 | Quality |
| Email open rate | >40% | Engagement |
| Response rate | >15% | Interest |
| Time to sell | <14 days | List quality |

### Red Flags

- Open rates dropping → Clean list, improve subject lines
- No responses to deals → Not matching criteria, or list is cold
- Same buyers never closing → Requalify or remove

## Pro Tips

### 1. Quality > Quantity
25 A-buyers beats 500 unqualified contacts. Focus on people who actually close deals.

### 2. Buyers Want Deals, Not Spam
Only send when you have real inventory. Weekly max. Don't cry wolf.

### 3. Speed Wins
Text or call A-buyers before email blasts. First to respond often gets the deal.

### 4. Referrals Are Gold
After every closing: "Know anyone else looking for land?" One satisfied buyer can refer 5 more.

### 5. Keep It Warm
Touch your list monthly even without deals. Market updates, insights, check-ins. Cold lists don't convert.

### 6. Use Assignment Fees as Social Proof
"I just assigned a 10-acre parcel in [County] for $12K profit" attracts more buyers than "I have deals."

## Sample Buyer Qualification Call Script

```
"Hey [Name], this is [Your name] from Dirt Roamers. I source off-market land deals and wanted to connect about what you're looking for.

[If they're interested, continue:]

A few quick questions so I can send you the right deals:

1. What areas are you actively buying in right now?

2. What acreage range works for you?

3. What's your typical budget per deal?

4. Are you paying cash, or do you use financing?

5. How quickly can you typically close if you like something?

6. How many land deals are you trying to do this year?

Perfect. I'll add you to my list and when something matches, you'll hear from me first. Sound good?

[Get their email confirmed]

Great, talk soon."
```
