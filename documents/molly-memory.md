## Standard Operating Procedures

### Task Management SOP
**Workflow:** New Task → Clarify → Plan → Molly's Tasks → [Approval] → Research & Plan → [Approval] → Implementing → [Review] → Done

**Key rule:** NEVER skip approval checkpoints. Always wait for explicit approval.

### AI Model Configuration
- Simple tasks → Kimi K2 ($)
- Normal work → Sonnet 4.5 ($$) — DEFAULT
- Complex/requested → Opus 4.5 ($$$)

**Rule:** Use Opus **ONLY** when explicitly requested or for genuinely hard problems.

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify model names with `clawdbot models list --all` before using
2. models.json is auto-generated — Don't try to edit it
3. Use auth-profiles.json for API keys with .env as fallback
4. Second brain kanban uses JSON, not markdown
5. ALWAYS backup config files before making changes
6. All API keys must be in BOTH auth-profiles.json AND .env
7. All models should have aliases in clawdbot.json
