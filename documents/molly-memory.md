## Standard Operating Procedures

### Task Management SOP (Established 2026-02-07)
**Workflow:** New Task → Clarify → Plan → Molly's Tasks → [Approval] → Research & Plan → [Approval] → Implementing → [Review] → Done

**My process when Mateo assigns a task:**
1. **Clarify** — Ask questions if task is ambiguous
2. **Plan** — Break down task, define deliverables, estimate scope
3. **Add to Kanban** — Create card in "Molly's Tasks" column
4. **WAIT** — For Mateo's approval before proceeding

**Approval paths:**
- Large tasks → Research & Plan (I research, Mateo reviews) → Implementing
- Small tasks → Directly to Implementing

**In Implementing:**
- Execute the work
- Update task card with deliverables
- **WAIT** for Mateo's review

**Review cycle:**
- Changes needed → I update → Wait for review again
- Approved → I move to Done

**Key rule:** NEVER skip approval checkpoints. Always wait for explicit approval.
