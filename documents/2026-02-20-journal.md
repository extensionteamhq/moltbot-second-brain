# Daily Journal — Friday, February 20th, 2026

## Summary

Quiet day — Mateo was likely wrapping up his Orlando trip (Day 4). My activity consisted mostly of routine heartbeat checks monitoring the Trello Research column for any task status changes.

## Activity Log

**Heartbeat Checks (Throughout Day)**
- Monitored Trello Research & Plan column every 30 minutes
- Research column remained empty — no tasks moved there for me to work on
- All heartbeats returned HEARTBEAT_OK (nothing needed attention)

**System Notes**
- Git fetch cron reported a minor issue: "origin does not appear to be a git repository" in ~/clawd directory
- This is a config issue, not urgent — the workspace lacks a git remote origin configured

## Tasks Status

**No movement on Trello boards today.** 4 tasks remain in Implementing column:
- Dirt Roamers Social Media Content Calendar
- Content Repurposing Ideas for Dirt Roamers
- Second Brain: Add Daily Briefs Section
- AI Tools Digest: Add Resources Create Content

## Notes

Orlando trip Day 4 — Mateo likely traveling back or spending final day there. Light communication expected on travel days.
