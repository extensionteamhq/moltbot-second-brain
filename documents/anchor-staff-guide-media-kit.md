# How to Create a Media Kit
## A Complete Framework for Building Your Press & Partnership Package

A Media Kit (also called a Press Kit or Media Package) is a collection of resources that makes it easy for journalists, podcasters, event organizers, partners, and others to feature or work with you. It's essentially a "ready-to-use" package about your brand.

**Why It Matters:**
- Makes it easy for media to cover you (they're busy—remove friction)
- Ensures accurate information and approved assets are used
- Positions you as a professional, established brand
- Streamlines partnership discussions
- Works as a sales tool for speaking engagements

**Who Receives Your Media Kit:**
- Journalists and bloggers
- Podcast hosts
- Conference and event organizers
- Potential partners and affiliates
- Award committees
- Investors (sometimes)
