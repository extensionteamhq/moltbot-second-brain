# Deal Analysis & Underwriting Guide for Land Investors

*Last updated: February 15, 2026*

---

## Overview

This guide covers how to analyze land deals, estimate market value, and calculate your maximum offer prices. Unlike house flipping where MAO formulas account for rehab costs, land deals focus on acquisition discounts, holding costs, and exit strategy margins.

**Mateo's Two-Offer Strategy:**
1. **Cash Offer:** 40-50% of market value
2. **Seller Financing Offer:** 80-90% of market value (if terms work)

Understanding how to comp land accurately is the foundation that makes this strategy work.

## Part 1: Estimating Market Value (Comping Vacant Land)

### Why Land Comps Are Different

Comping vacant land is harder than residential properties because:
- **Less data** — fewer transactions, irregular sales
- **Unique attributes** — no two parcels are identical
- **Multiple value factors** — access, utilities, topography, zoning all matter
- **Fewer standard metrics** — no "price per square foot" benchmarks like houses

Unlike houses, where appraisers use income approach, cost approach, or sales comparison, **land almost always requires sales comparison** since there's no income or improvements.

### The 5-Step Comping Process

#### Step 1: Define the Property Profile

Before searching for comps, document your subject property:

| Attribute | Your Property | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Acreage | | Exact or within ±20% |
| Zoning | | Residential, agricultural, commercial |
| Access | | Paved road, gravel, dirt, landlocked |
| Utilities | | Electric, water, sewer, none |
| Topography | | Flat, rolling, steep |
| Flood zone | | Yes/No (FEMA maps) |
| County/Location | | Township, distance to town |

#### Step 2: Search for Comparable Sales

**Primary Tools:**
- **Redfin** — Best filters for lot size and sold properties
- **Zillow** — Good secondary source
- **Land Portal** — Land-specific data (if subscribed)
- **County GIS/Assessor** — Official sales records

**Redfin Search Process:**
1. Enter address or nearby address
2. Change "For Sale" → "Sold"
3. Set timeframe (start with 3 months, expand to 6-12 if needed)
4. Change "Home Type" → "Land"
5. Filter by lot size (±20% of your acreage)
6. Zoom out gradually if no results

**Ideal comp radius:**
- Infill lots: 1-2 miles
- Rural 5-10 acres: 5-10 miles
- Large rural parcels: Same county

#### Step 3: Filter for True Comparables

Not all "comps" are actually comparable. Filter by:

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Acreage** | High | Stay within ±30% of subject |
| **Zoning** | High | Must match use potential |
| **Access** | High | Paved vs. landlocked = huge difference |
| **Utilities** | Medium | Available vs. off-grid |
| **Topography** | Medium | Buildable vs. unusable |
| **Flood zone** | High | Properties in flood zones worth 30-50% less |
| **Time of sale** | Medium | Recent sales (6-12 months) preferred |

**Red flags to watch:**
- Family sales (often below market)
- Foreclosure/tax sales (distressed pricing)
- Assemblage sales (premium for adjacent lots)
- Developer purchases (bulk pricing)

#### Step 4: Calculate Price Per Acre

For each comp, calculate:

```
Price Per Acre = Sale Price ÷ Acreage
```

**Example comp analysis:**

| Comp | Acres | Sale Price | Price/Acre | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|------------|-------|
| A | 8.5 | $42,500 | $5,000 | Paved road, power |
| B | 10.2 | $45,900 | $4,500 | Gravel road, power |
| C | 7.8 | $31,200 | $4,000 | Dirt road, no utils |
| D | 9.1 | $50,050 | $5,500 | Paved, power, water |

**Adjustment framework:**

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Paved road vs. gravel | +10-15% |
| Gravel vs. dirt | +5-10% |
| Power at lot vs. 500ft away | +$3,000-5,000 |
| Water available | +$2,000-5,000 |
| Sewer available | +$5,000-10,000 |
| Flood zone | -30-50% |
| Landlocked | -40-60% |

#### Step 5: Determine Market Value Range

After analyzing 3-5 good comps:

1. **Remove outliers** — Ignore highest and lowest if they seem off
2. **Calculate average** — Price per acre × your acreage
3. **Establish range** — Low, mid, high estimates
4. **Adjust for unique factors** — Access, utilities, special features

**Example calculation:**

```
Average price/acre from comps: $4,750
Subject property: 10 acres
Base value: $47,500

Adjustments:
- Has paved road access: +$0 (already in comps)
- Power at property line: +$0 (similar to comps)
- Slightly steeper topography: -$2,500

Adjusted Market Value: $45,000
Value Range: $40,000 - $50,000
```

## Part 2: Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) for Land

### Land Flipping MAO Formula

Unlike house flipping's `ARV × 70% - Repairs = MAO`, land uses:

```
MAO (Cash) = Market Value × Target Discount %
MAO (Terms) = Market Value × Seller Finance Multiplier
```

### Cash Offer Calculation

**Target: 40-50% of market value**

```
Cash MAO = Market Value × 0.40 to 0.50
```

**Example:**
- Market value: $50,000
- Cash offer range: $20,000 - $25,000
- Starting offer: $20,000 (40%)
- Walk-away max: $25,000 (50%)

**Why 40-50%?**

| % of MV | Scenario |
|---------|----------|
| 20-30% | Fire sale, highly motivated, tax liens |
| 40-50% | Standard cash offer, good margin |
| 50-60% | Competitive market, thinner margin |
| 60%+ | Rarely profitable for flipping |

**Built-in margin accounts for:**
- Closing costs (buyer side): 1-3%
- Holding costs: Property taxes, insurance
- Marketing/disposition costs: 5-10%
- Desired profit: 25-50% return minimum

### Seller Financing Offer Calculation

**Target: 80-90% of market value**

```
Seller Finance MAO = Market Value × 0.80 to 0.90
```

**Example:**
- Market value: $50,000
- Seller finance offer: $40,000 - $45,000
- Terms: 0% interest, 10-year amortization, balloon at 3-5 years

**Why sellers accept seller financing:**
- Higher total price (close to market value)
- Monthly income stream
- Potential tax benefits (installment sale)
- Faster sale than waiting for cash buyer

**Ideal seller finance terms:**

| Element | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Down payment | $0 or minimal |
| Interest rate | 0-5% |
| Monthly payment | Enough to cover your resale note |
| Term | 7-10 years |
| Balloon | 3-5 years |

## Part 3: Exit Value Projections

### Exit Strategy Matrix

| Exit Type | Sale Price Target | Timeline | Use When |
|-----------|------------------|----------|----------|
| Quick flip (cash buyer) | 80-90% of MV | 1-3 months | Need fast capital |
| Retail sale (cash) | 95-100% of MV | 3-6 months | Maximize profit |
| Seller finance to buyer | 100-120% of MV | 1-3 months to contract | Best total return |

### Profit Projections by Exit

**Scenario: Buy at $25,000 (50% of $50K MV)**

| Exit Strategy | Sale Price | Gross Profit | Notes |
|---------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Quick flip @ 80% MV | $40,000 | $15,000 | Fast, lower return |
| Retail sale @ 95% MV | $47,500 | $22,500 | Medium effort |
| Seller finance @ 110% MV | $55,000 | $30,000+ | Plus interest income |

**Seller financing math (buyer side):**

```
Sale price: $55,000 (110% of $50K MV)
Down payment required: $11,000 (20%)
Amount financed to buyer: $44,000
Your terms: 10%, 15-year amort, 7-year balloon
Monthly payment to you: ~$473
Your acquisition cost: $25,000
Immediate profit from down: $11,000 - $25,000 = -$14,000 owed
After 7 years balloon: ~$36,000 remaining balance
Total cash received: $11,000 + ($473 × 84) + $36,000 = ~$86,700
Total profit: ~$61,700 on $25K invested
```

## Part 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Overestimating Market Value

**Mistake:** Using asking prices instead of sold prices, or using comps that aren't truly comparable.

**Fix:** Only use actual closed sales. Verify comps match your property's access, utilities, and zoning.

### 2. Ignoring Access Issues

**Mistake:** Buying landlocked property without legal easement.

**Fix:** Always verify deeded road access. Landlocked = 40-60% value reduction minimum.

### 3. Not Accounting for All Costs

**Mistake:** Calculating profit without closing costs, holding costs, or selling costs.

**Fix:** Use the full cost stack:
- Buy-side closing: 1-3% of purchase
- Holding (taxes, insurance): ~2% annually
- Sell-side closing: 3-5% if using agent, 1-2% if FSBO
- Marketing: $200-500 for listings, photos

### 4. Overpaying for "Potential"

**Mistake:** Paying current value for future development potential that may never materialize.

**Fix:** Price based on current use/zoning. Development upside is your bonus, not the basis.

### 5. Skipping Due Diligence

**Mistake:** Making offers before verifying title, taxes, liens, environmental issues.

**Fix:** Always pull title search, verify back taxes, check for liens. Reference the Due Diligence Checklist (Document #09).

### 6. Not Testing Your Scripts

**Mistake:** Making 1,000 offers based on untested pricing before knowing if deals will close.

**Fix:** Start with 50-100 targeted leads. Adjust offer percentages based on response rate and deal quality.
