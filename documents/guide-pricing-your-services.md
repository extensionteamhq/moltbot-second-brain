# How to Price Your Services: A Guide for New Service Providers
*For freelancers and consultants offering automation, AI integration, and technical services*

---

## The Reality of Entrepreneurial Time

As a W2 employee, you might work 40 hours a week and get paid for all of them. As a service provider, that math doesn't work.

**Your real billable capacity:**

| Activity | Hours/Week |
|----------|------------|
| Client billable work | 20-25 |
| Sales & discovery calls | 3-5 |
| Marketing & content | 3-5 |
| Admin & operations | 3-5 |
| Bookkeeping & invoicing | 1-2 |
| Learning & skill development | 2-4 |
| Buffer for scope creep | 2-3 |

**Realistic billable hours: 20-25 per week = 1,000-1,300 hours/year**

This is the number that matters when calculating your rates.

## Step 1: Calculate Your Baseline Cost

Before you can price profitably, you need to know what it actually costs to run your business and live your life.

### Personal Expenses (Annual)
- Housing (rent/mortgage)
- Food & groceries
- Transportation
- Health insurance (if self-funded)
- Utilities
- Personal insurance
- Savings & retirement contributions
- Entertainment & lifestyle
- Emergency fund contributions

**Your Target Personal Income: $__________/year**

### Business Operating Costs (Annual)
| Category | Typical Range |
|----------|---------------|
| Software & tools | $2,000 - $10,000 |
| Insurance (E&O, liability) | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| Accounting & legal | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| Marketing & advertising | $2,000 - $10,000 |
| Professional development | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| Equipment & hardware | $1,000 - $3,000 |
| Coworking/office (optional) | $0 - $6,000 |
| Subscriptions & memberships | $500 - $2,000 |

**Your Business Costs: $__________/year**

### The Tax Multiplier

As a self-employed person, you pay both sides of payroll taxes plus income tax.

| Tax Type | Approximate Rate |
|----------|-----------------|
| Self-employment tax | 15.3% |
| Federal income tax | 12-32% (varies by bracket) |
| State income tax | 0-13% (varies by state) |

**Rule of thumb:** Set aside 25-35% of gross revenue for taxes.

**Tax Reserve Rate: ______%**

---

## Step 2: Calculate Your Minimum Hourly Rate

### The Formula

```
Minimum Hourly Rate = (Target Income + Business Costs) / (1 - Tax Rate) / Billable Hours

Example:
- Target Income: $100,000
- Business Costs: $15,000
- Tax Rate: 30%
- Billable Hours: 1,200/year

Rate = ($100,000 + $15,000) / (1 - 0.30) / 1,200
Rate = $115,000 / 0.70 / 1,200
Rate = $164,285 / 1,200
Rate = $137/hour MINIMUM
```

This is your **floor** - the absolute minimum to break even on your goals. You should charge MORE than this.

### Your Calculation

```
Target Income:        $_________
+ Business Costs:     $_________
= Subtotal:           $_________
/ (1 - Tax Rate):     / (1 - _____)
= Pre-tax needed:     $_________
/ Billable Hours:     / _________
= MINIMUM RATE:       $_________/hour
```

## Step 3: From Hourly to Day Rate

### The Day Rate Formula

A day rate isn't just 8x your hourly rate. It should include:
- A slight discount for guaranteed full-day commitment
- Recognition of context-switching costs you're avoiding
- Premium for dedicating an entire day exclusively

**Day Rate = Hourly Rate x 6-7 hours**

Why not 8? Because:
- Meetings and communication eat into work time
- You need breaks to maintain quality
- Some time goes to setup and context

| Hourly Rate | Day Rate (x6.5) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| $100 | $650 |
| $150 | $975 |
| $200 | $1,300 |
| $250 | $1,625 |
| $300 | $1,950 |

**Your Day Rate: $__________**

## Step 4: Project-Based Pricing

Project pricing is where you can significantly increase your effective hourly rate. Here's how to do it right.

### The Value-Based Approach

Instead of estimating hours and multiplying, consider:

1. **What is the outcome worth to the client?**
   - Revenue increase potential
   - Cost savings
   - Time savings
   - Risk reduction

2. **Price based on a percentage of value delivered**
   - Typical range: 10-25% of first-year value
   - Example: Automation saves client 20 hours/month at $50/hour = $12,000/year value
   - Your fee: $1,200 - $3,000 for the project

### The Estimation Method (When Value is Hard to Quantify)

```
Project Price = (Estimated Hours x Hourly Rate) x Complexity Multiplier x Risk Buffer

Complexity Multipliers:
- Simple/Familiar: 1.0x
- Moderate: 1.25x
- Complex/New tech: 1.5x
- Highly complex: 2.0x

Risk Buffer: Add 15-30% for unknowns
```

### Project Pricing Tiers

Create packages at different price points:

| Tier | Description | Price Range |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Starter | Single automation, basic integration | $500 - $2,000 |
| Professional | Multi-step workflow, 2-3 integrations | $2,000 - $7,500 |
| Enterprise | Complex system, multiple workflows, training | $7,500 - $25,000+ |

**Pro tip:** Always present 3 options. Most clients pick the middle one.

## Step 5: Market Positioning

Your rate needs to align with market expectations while reflecting your value.

### Research Your Market

1. **Check freelance platforms** (for baseline - usually lower)
   - Upwork, Toptal, Fiverr Pro
   
2. **Review agency pricing** (for ceiling)
   - Agencies charge $150-400/hour for similar work
   
3. **Ask in communities**
   - Slack groups, Discord servers, Reddit
   - What are others charging for similar work?

### Positioning Strategies

| Position | Rate Range | Client Type | Marketing Focus |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Budget | $50-100/hr | Price-sensitive, small biz | Volume, quick turnaround |
| Mid-Market | $100-175/hr | Growing businesses | Reliability, results |
| Premium | $175-300/hr | Established companies | Expertise, strategy |
| Expert | $300+/hr | Enterprise, high-stakes | Specialization, track record |

### Where Should You Start?

**New with skills but no portfolio:** Mid-market minus 15-20%
**Some experience and testimonials:** Full mid-market
**Specialized expertise:** Premium tier
**Recognized expert/published/speaking:** Expert tier

## Step 6: Subcontractor Rates (When Someone Else Brings the Work)

When an agency, consultant, or sales partner brings you work, they expect a discount. Here's how to think about it:

### What They're Providing
- Lead generation (huge cost/effort)
- Sales & closing
- Client relationship management
- Project scoping
- Often: project management
- Payment guarantee (sometimes)

### The Discount Framework

| Scenario | Typical Discount | Your Rate |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| They handle sales + PM | 30-40% off retail | 60-70% of your rate |
| They handle sales only | 20-30% off retail | 70-80% of your rate |
| Referral only (you close) | 10-15% off retail | 85-90% of your rate |
| White-label (their brand) | 40-50% off retail | 50-60% of your rate |

### Example Calculation

```
Your Direct Rate: $150/hour
Agency Subcontract (they handle sales + PM): $150 x 0.65 = $97.50/hour
Referral Partner (you close): $150 x 0.85 = $127.50/hour
```

### When Subcontracting Makes Sense

**Take the lower rate when:**
- You have available capacity
- It fills gaps between direct clients
- The relationship could lead to more work
- You're building experience/portfolio
- The work is straightforward (lower cognitive load)

**Negotiate or decline when:**
- You're at capacity with direct clients
- The rate is below your minimum (calculated in Step 2)
- The work is complex but the rate is commodity-level
- Payment terms are unfavorable

### Setting Subcontractor Minimums

Calculate a separate floor for subcontract work:

```
Subcontract Minimum = Your Minimum Rate x 0.75

If your minimum is $137/hour:
Subcontract floor = $137 x 0.75 = $103/hour

Below this, you're losing money even without marketing costs.
```

## Step 7: Putting It All Together

### Your Rate Card

Create a personal rate card (don't share exact numbers with clients):

```
DIRECT CLIENT RATES
-------------------
Hourly: $________/hour (minimum 2-hour engagement)
Half-day (4 hours): $________
Full-day (8 hours): $________
Weekly retainer: $________/week

PROJECT RATES
-------------
Small project: $________ - $________
Medium project: $________ - $________
Large project: $________ - $________

SUBCONTRACTOR RATES
-------------------
Standard (sales + PM handled): $________/hour
Referral partner: $________/hour
White-label: $________/hour
Absolute floor: $________/hour
```

### Communication Tips

**Never say your rate first.** Ask about their budget or share a range.

**Frame it in value terms:**
- "Most clients in your situation invest $X-Y for this type of project"
- "Based on the outcomes you described, this typically runs $X"

**Handle objections:**
- "That's outside our budget" → "What would make this work for you? Let's see if we can adjust the scope."
- "That's higher than others" → "I understand. My clients typically find the investment pays for itself within [timeframe] because [value]."

## Final Thoughts

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Pricing based on your old salary** - Your W2 salary had benefits paid on top
2. **Not accounting for non-billable time** - Half your time isn't billable
3. **Racing to the bottom** - Cheap clients are often the most demanding
4. **Not raising rates** - Review and adjust every 6-12 months
5. **Apologizing for your rates** - Your price reflects your value

### Signs You Need to Raise Your Rates

- You're booked solid for 2+ months out
- Clients say yes immediately without negotiating
- You're turning away work
- You haven't raised rates in 12+ months
- Your skills have significantly improved

### The Confidence Factor

Your rate is a signal. Charge too little and clients wonder what's wrong. Charge appropriately and they see you as a professional.

**You're not selling hours. You're selling outcomes.**
