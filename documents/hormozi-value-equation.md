# Alex Hormozi's Value Equation

The framework for creating irresistible offers from *$100M Offers*.

## The Formula

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
        ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**To increase value:**
- ⬆️ Increase dream outcome
- ⬆️ Increase perceived likelihood
- ⬇️ Decrease time to result
- ⬇️ Decrease effort required

## Breaking It Down

### Dream Outcome
What do they *really* want? Go deeper than surface.
- Surface: "I want to sell my land"
- Deeper: "I want the stress gone and cash in my pocket"

### Perceived Likelihood
Why should they believe it'll work for them?
- Social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- Guarantees (risk reversal)
- Authority (credentials, experience)

### Time Delay
How fast can you deliver results?
- "Close in 7 days" beats "Close in 30 days"
- Speed is a feature

### Effort & Sacrifice
What do they have to do/give up?
- "We handle everything" = low effort
- "No repairs, no showings, no agents"

## Application: Dirt Roamers Offer

| Element | Current | Optimized |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Dream Outcome | Sell your land | Get cash, eliminate stress, move on |
| Likelihood | "We buy land" | "347 landowners paid this year" |
| Time | "Fast closing" | "Cash in 7 days guaranteed" |
| Effort | "Easy process" | "One call. We do the rest." |

## Grand Slam Offer Stack
