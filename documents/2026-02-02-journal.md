# Daily Journal - February 2, 2026

## Topics Discussed

- **Cron Job Reliability** — Diagnosed why scheduled tasks were failing (empty heartbeat file causing skips)
- **Second Brain Mobile Fix** — Fixed responsive layout with hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **System Architecture** — Removed heartbeat dependency, enabled gateway restart permissions
- **Schedule Standardization** — Aligned all cron jobs to Eastern time zone

## Decisions Made

- Removed HEARTBEAT.md — crons should fire directly with `wakeMode: "now"`
- New cron schedule (all Eastern):
  - 6 AM: Morning brief
  - 8 AM: Calendar events (test)
  - 6 PM: Accountability check-in
  - Midnight: Second Brain update + git push
- Enabled `commands.restart: true` in gateway config for self-service restarts

## Action Items

- [ ] Verify calendar events cron fires at 8 AM Eastern
- [ ] Verify morning brief fires tomorrow at 6 AM Eastern
- [ ] Monitor Second Brain auto-updates at midnight
- [ ] Check SubTo coaching calendar for upcoming sessions

## Key Insights

> "The gap between knowing and doing is larger than the gap between ignorance and knowledge." — Execution beats planning.

> Scheduled tasks need to be bulletproof. If they fail silently, the whole system loses trust.

## Summary

Major infrastructure day. Fixed the cron reliability issue that was causing missed morning briefs and accountability check-ins. Root cause: the scheduler was checking for HEARTBEAT.md content and skipping jobs when empty. Removed the heartbeat dependency entirely. Also fixed Second Brain mobile layout and standardized all schedules to Eastern time. System should now be reliable for daily automated tasks.
