	Loan Payment Calculations
Monthly Interest Rate: 10% ÷ 12 = 0.8333% (0.008333 as decimal)


Number of Payments: 18 months


Monthly Payment Formula:


PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]


Where:


P = Principal ($60,000)


r = Monthly interest rate (0.008333)


n = Number of payments (18)


PMT = 60,000 × [0.008333(1.008333)^18] / [(1.008333)^18 - 1]


PMT = 60,000 × [0.008333 × 1.1605] / [1.1605 - 1]


PMT = 60,000 × 0.009671 / 0.1605


PMT = 60,000 × 0.06025


PMT = $3,615 per month


Total Payment: $3,615 × 18 = $65,070


Total Interest Paid: $65,070 - $60,000 = $5,070


Effective Interest Cost: 8.45% of principal (paid over 18 months)

SCENARIO PLANNING PARAMETERS
Conservative Scenario Assumptions
* Site ranking time: 9 months average
* First revenue: Month 12
* Client close rate: 60%
* Average monthly fee: $900 (10% below target)
* Monthly churn: 3.0%
* Sites launched: 10 (no expansion year 1)
Expected Scenario Assumptions
* Site ranking time: 6 months average
* First revenue: Month 8
* Client close rate: 70%
* Average monthly fee: $1,000 (on target)
* Monthly churn: 2.1%
* Sites launched: 10 + 3 expansion in months 13-18
Optimistic Scenario Assumptions
* Site ranking time: 4 months average
* First revenue: Month 5
* Client close rate: 80%
* Average monthly fee: $1,100 (premium pricing)
* Monthly churn: 1.5%
* Sites launched: 10 + 5 expansion in months 10-18


________________


KEY FINANCIAL METRICS
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
DSCR = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service


Target DSCR: 1.25 or higher (comfortable coverage)


Minimum DSCR: 1.00 (break-even coverage)


Example at $10K monthly revenue:


NOI = $10,000 - $1,700 - $600 = $7,700


Debt Service = $3,615


DSCR = $7,700 / $3,615 = 2.13


This indicates strong ability to service debt.
Return on Investment (ROI) for Lender
Total Return = (Interest Paid / Principal) × (12 / Loan Term in Months)


18-Month Loan ROI:


= ($5,070 / $60,000) × (12 / 18)


= 8.45% × 0.667


= 5.63% annual return


This is competitive with other PML opportunities while 


being secured by business assets (ranked websites).
Payback Period for Business
Payback Period = Cumulative months until cumulative cash 


flow turns positive


Expected Scenario:


- Months 1-7: -$44,905 cumulative (burn)


- Month 8: -$48,020 (first revenue less expenses)


- Month 12: -$27,380 (strong revenue, approaching breakeven)


- Month 14: +$2,185 (cash flow positive)


- Month 18: +$31,515 (cumulative positive cash flow)


Payback Period: 14 months

CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT
Monthly Cash Flow Formula
Beginning Cash Balance


+ Revenue Collected


- Operating Expenses


- Development Expenses


- Loan Payment


= Ending Cash Balance
Minimum Cash Reserve Target
* Months 1-6: $5,000 minimum (emergency only)
* Months 7-12: $10,000 minimum (1.5x monthly burn)
* Months 13-18: $15,000 minimum (2x monthly burn)
* Post-Loan: 3 months operating expenses ($15,000+)
Cash Flow Triggers
Cash Balance
	Action Required
	Below $5,000
	Pause new site development, focus on ranking existing sites
	Below $10,000 (after Month 6)
	Reduce variable expenses, accelerate client closing
	Below $15,000 (after Month 12)
	Review and adjust strategy, consider bridge financing

VALIDATION & SOURCES
Industry Benchmarks Referenced
* SEO ranking timelines: Ahrefs, Moz industry studies (3-6 month average for new sites)
* Lead generation rates: Home service industry averages (20-40 leads/month typical for ranked sites)
* Client LTV: SaaS industry benchmarks (3-5 year retention standard for high-value B2B)
* CAC standards: Service industry norms ($500-2,000 typical)
Conservative Approach Justification
All assumptions err on the side of caution:


* Ranking timelines: 6 months (industry average 3-6)
* Revenue ramp: Gradual (vs. immediate full price)
* Retention: 4 years (vs. indefinite)
* Close rates: 70% (with free lead strategy, could be 80-90%)


This conservative approach ensures the business plan is credible, defendable, and likely to outperform projections.
