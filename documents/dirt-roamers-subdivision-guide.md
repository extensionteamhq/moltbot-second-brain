# Land Subdivision Guide for Investors

*Research Date: February 11, 2026*
*Focus: Mateo's target markets (FL, GA, TN, NC, SC, AL, MT)*

---

## Executive Summary

Subdivision is a powerful value-add strategy for land investors. By dividing larger parcels into smaller lots, you can:
- **Increase per-acre value** (smaller lots = higher $/acre)
- **Expand buyer pool** (more affordable entry points)
- **Reduce risk** (sell incrementally, recoup basis faster)
- **Create forced appreciation** (more lots = more building potential)

**Bottom Line:** For Mateo's 5-50 acre strategy, minor subdivisions (2-5 lots) are the sweet spot. Major subdivisions (6+ lots) involve significant infrastructure costs and risk.

---

## Subdivision Types

### 1. Subdivision Without County Approval
- **Best for:** Large rural parcels where each new lot exceeds minimum acreage (typically 10-36 acres)
- **Pros:** Fastest, cheapest, least hassle
- **Cons:** Limited use cases, requires larger parent parcels
- **Example:** Split 160 acres into 4x 40-acre lots (if zoning allows 40-acre minimum)

### 2. Minor Subdivision (RECOMMENDED)
- **Best for:** Creating 2-5 new lots from a parent parcel
- **Pros:** Reasonable cost ($2,000-$10,000), predictable timeline (4-6 months), minimal infrastructure requirements
- **Cons:** Limited to 5 or fewer new parcels in most jurisdictions
- **Example:** Split 20 acres into 4x 5-acre lots (if zoning allows 5-acre minimum)

### 3. Major Subdivision
- **Best for:** Large developments (6+ lots), community building
- **Pros:** Can create many lots, highest profit potential
- **Cons:** Expensive ($50,000-$100,000+), lengthy (12-24 months), requires infrastructure (roads, utilities, sewer), public hearings, significant risk
- **When to consider:** Phase 2+ homesteading community vision, after capital accumulation

## Cost Breakdown

### Minor Subdivision (2-5 lots)

| Expense | Cost Range | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Survey** | $1,500-$4,000 | Higher for remote/difficult access |
| **Plat Map & Legal Descriptions** | Included in survey | Or $500-$1,000 separately |
| **County Application Fee** | $100-$500 | Often $100 per new parcel |
| **Recording Fees** | $30-$100 | Per new deed |
| **Title Search** | $200-$500 | Check for deed restrictions |
| **Attorney (if needed)** | $500-$2,000 | GA, NC, SC require attorney closings |

**Total Minor Subdivision: $2,500-$8,000**

### Additional Costs (If Required)

| Expense | Cost Range | When Needed |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Road Installation | $10,000-$30,000 | If no existing access |
| Utility Extension | $15,000-$50,000 | Power, water, sewer |
| Septic/Perc Tests | $500-$1,500 per lot | Rural lots without sewer |
| Zoning Variance | $500-$2,500 | If zoning doesn't allow split |
| Engineering Studies | $2,000-$10,000 | Complex terrain/drainage |

**Warning:** If infrastructure improvements are required, costs can balloon to $50,000-$100,000+. This pushes into major subdivision territory.

## Timeline

### Typical Minor Subdivision: 4-6 Months

| Phase | Duration | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **1. Survey** | 6-8 weeks | Surveyor lead time + fieldwork + plat creation |
| **2. Application** | 2-4 weeks | County review (some rural counties auto-approve at 30 days) |
| **3. Recording** | 1-2 weeks | File new deeds with county |
| **4. Cartography** | 2-4 weeks | New parcels appear in county mapping |

**Total: 4-6 months** (can stretch to 9-12 months for complex projects)

### Factors That Extend Timeline
- Zoning variances needed
- Public hearings required
- Infrastructure improvements
- Understaffed rural county offices
- HOA/POA approval process

## Zoning Considerations

### Critical Questions Before Buying

1. **What is the current zoning classification?**
   - Rural-10 = 10-acre minimum lot size
   - Rural-2 = 2-acre minimum lot size
   - Agricultural = varies widely

2. **How many lots can I create?**
   - Minor subdivision typically capped at 5 new parcels
   - Calculate: Parent acreage ÷ minimum lot size = max lots

3. **Are there deed restrictions or CC&Rs?**
   - HOA/POA may prohibit or limit subdivision
   - Old deed restrictions may not show up without title search

4. **What infrastructure is required?**
   - Road frontage requirements?
   - Utility access for each lot?
   - Perc test requirements?

### Example Calculations

**Good Candidate:**
- 25-acre parcel, zoned Rural-5 (5-acre minimum)
- Can create 5 lots (25 ÷ 5 = 5) ✅
- Existing road access on two sides
- Power at road frontage
- Minor subdivision process applies

**Bad Candidate:**
- 25-acre parcel, zoned Rural-10 (10-acre minimum)
- Can only create 2 lots (25 ÷ 10 = 2.5, round down)
- Landlocked, needs road easement
- No utilities within 1 mile
- May not be worth the cost/hassle

## The Subdivision Process (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Due Diligence (Before Purchase)

1. **Check zoning** — Call county planning/zoning office
2. **Review CC&Rs** — Request from HOA or title company
3. **Run title search** — Check for deed restrictions
4. **Verify access** — Each lot needs legal road access
5. **Assess utilities** — Power, water, septic feasibility
6. **Evaluate market** — Are smaller lots sellable here?

### Phase 2: Professional Engagement

1. **Find a surveyor** — Get 3+ quotes, check references
   - Ask: Experience with subdivisions in this county?
   - Ask: Relationships with county planning office?
   - Ask: Timeline and what's included?

2. **Title company** — Verify ownership, check restrictions

3. **Attorney (if needed)** — For GA, NC, SC closings or zoning issues

### Phase 3: Survey & Plat

1. Surveyor conducts fieldwork
2. Creates plat map showing new lot boundaries
3. Writes new legal descriptions for each lot
4. Reviews with county for compliance

### Phase 4: County Application

1. Submit minor land division application
2. Include: plat map, certificate of title, application fee
3. Wait for county review (2-4 weeks typical)
4. May require planning board meeting or public notice

### Phase 5: Approval & Recording

1. Receive county approval
2. Record new deeds with county recorder
3. Pay recording fees
4. Request cartography update (new APNs assigned)

### Phase 6: Marketing

1. New parcels appear in county system
2. Each lot has separate APN
3. Can sell individually or in combinations
4. List on land platforms (see 07-land-listing-platforms.md)

## Profit Potential

### The Math

**Rule of Thumb:** Subdivided lots sell for 20-50% more per acre than the parent parcel.

**Example:**
- Buy: 20 acres at $5,000/acre = $100,000
- Subdivision cost: $5,000
- Total invested: $105,000

**Scenario A: Sell as-is**
- Sell at $6,500/acre = $130,000
- Profit: $25,000 (25% margin)

**Scenario B: Subdivide into 4x 5-acre lots**
- Sell each at $40,000 ($8,000/acre)
- Total: $160,000
- Profit: $55,000 (52% margin)

**Subdivision added $30,000 in value** (spent $5,000, gained $30,000 = 6x ROI)

### When Subdivision Makes Sense

✅ **Do subdivide when:**
- Per-acre value increases significantly for smaller lots
- Strong market demand for smaller parcels
- Minimal infrastructure needed
- Zoning allows desired lot sizes
- You have time (4-6 months minimum)

❌ **Don't subdivide when:**
- Infrastructure costs exceed profit potential
- Market prefers larger parcels
- Zoning requires expensive variances
- You need quick capital (flip as-is instead)
- Deal margin is tight

## Risk Management

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Hidden deed restrictions** — Always do title search
2. **Unexpected infrastructure requirements** — Talk to county early
3. **Zoning changes** — Verify before offer, confirm before close
4. **Survey surprises** — Encroachments, boundary disputes
5. **Market shifts** — 6+ month timeline = exposure to changes
6. **HOA/POA issues** — Get written confirmation of subdivision rights

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Contingency in purchase contract** — "Subject to subdivision approval"
- **Conservative underwriting** — Assume worst-case costs
- **Due diligence before earnest money** — Confirm subdivision feasibility
- **Start with smaller projects** — Learn process before scaling
- **Build surveyor relationships** — Good surveyor = smoother process

## Finding the Right Surveyor

### What to Look For

- **Local experience** — Knows county personnel and processes
- **Subdivision expertise** — Not just boundary surveys
- **Responsiveness** — Returns calls, meets deadlines
- **Clear pricing** — All-inclusive quotes, no surprises
- **References** — Other land investors who've used them

### Questions to Ask

1. How many subdivisions have you done in [county]?
2. What's your typical timeline?
3. What's included in your quote? (Survey, plat, legal descriptions?)
4. Do you handle the county application or do I?
5. What issues have you seen in this area?
6. Can you provide references?

### Finding Surveyors

- **County referrals** — Ask planning office who they recommend
- **Land investor networks** — REtipster, BiggerPockets, local REIAs
- **Title companies** — They work with surveyors regularly
- **Google/Yelp** — "Land surveyor [county name]"
- **State surveyor associations** — Professional directories

## Application to Dirt Roamers Strategy

### For 5-50 Acre Acquisitions

**Sweet Spot: 15-30 acres**
- Large enough to subdivide into 3-5 marketable lots
- Small enough to avoid major subdivision requirements
- Good balance of profit potential vs. complexity

**Ideal Zoning: Rural-5 or Rural-2**
- Allows creation of 5-acre or 2-acre lots
- Strong buyer demand at these sizes
- Homesteaders, builders, weekend retreats

### Target Market Subdivision Potential

| Market | Typical Zoning | Subdivision Opportunity |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| FL (Polk, Lake, Osceola) | Varies, often AG | High potential near growth areas |
| GA (Cherokee, Forsyth) | Often 1-5 acre | Strong demand for smaller lots |
| TN (Williamson, Wilson) | County-specific | Nashville exurbs = hot market |
| NC (Johnston, Union) | Often 2-5 acre | Charlotte growth = opportunity |
| SC (York, Horry) | Varies | Spillover markets from NC/beach |
| MT (Flathead, Gallatin) | Often 20+ acre | Lifestyle buyers pay premium |
| AL (Baldwin, Madison) | Relaxed zoning | Easier process, growing demand |

### Phased Approach

**Phase 1 (Now):** Focus on flip deals without subdivision
- Build capital and deal flow
- Learn markets and processes
- Identify subdivision-ready opportunities

**Phase 2 (After 5-10 deals):** Add subdivision to toolkit
- Start with simple 2-lot splits
- Test in one market first
- Build surveyor relationships

**Phase 3 (Scale):** Strategic subdivision on larger deals
- Buy 20-50 acre parcels with subdivision intent
- Maximize value-add before disposition
- Consider holding for homesteading community vision
