## Email 1 — Day 0: The Opener

**Subject:** Your [County] property — quick question

Hi [First Name],

My name's Mateo, and my wife and I run a small land business here in [State]. We came across your property on [Street/Road] and I wanted to reach out directly.

It seems like you've held onto this land for a while now — and there's usually a good reason for that. But I'm curious: have you ever thought about what it might look like to sell?

No pressure at all. We're not a big corporation with call centers and scripts. Just two people who love land and help folks when the timing is right.

If you're open to a conversation, I'd love to hear a bit about your situation. You can reply here, text me at [Phone], or give me a call.

Either way — thanks for reading this far.

Talk soon,

## Email 2 — Day 3: The Soft Follow-Up

**Subject:** Following up — no worries if not

Hey [First Name],

Just wanted to circle back on my note from a few days ago about your [County] property.

I get it — you probably get emails like this and think, "Here's another one." And honestly? You might be right to ignore most of them.

But if there's any part of you that's been wondering what the land might be worth or what your options look like, I'm happy to chat. No obligation, no sales pitch.

Would it be a bad idea to hop on a quick call this week?

Best,  
**Mateo**

## Email 3 — Day 9: The Labeling Email

**Subject:** It sounds like the timing might not be right

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, and that's totally fine. It sounds like selling might not be on your radar right now — and I respect that.

But here's the thing: sometimes people hold onto land because they're not sure what to do with it. Taxes come, years pass, and the land just... sits there.

If that's you — or if something changes down the road — my door's always open. We make fair cash offers and can close on your timeline, not ours.

Just reply "maybe later" and I'll check back in a few months. Or tell me "not interested" and I'll leave you alone.

Either way, I appreciate your time.

Warmly,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 4 — Day 16: The Accusation Audit

**Subject:** You're probably thinking I'll never stop emailing

Hey [First Name],

You're probably thinking: "This guy just won't give up."

And honestly? You're not wrong. I'm persistent because I've seen too many landowners sit on property for years — paying taxes, dealing with headaches — when they could've turned it into cash a long time ago.

I'm not saying that's you. But if there's even a small chance you've thought about selling, I'd love to learn more about your situation.

What would it take for you to consider an offer?

No pressure. Just a real question.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 5 — Day 30: The "No" Question

**Subject:** Would it be ridiculous to ask one more time?

Hi [First Name],

I know I've reached out a few times now, and I want to be respectful of your time.

Would it be ridiculous for me to ask one more time if you'd consider selling your [County] property?

If the answer is no — totally fine. Just let me know and I'll close your file. But if there's any chance, I'd love to have a quick conversation.

Thanks for your patience with me.

Talk soon,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 6 — Day 60: The Check-In

**Subject:** Just checking in

Hey [First Name],

It's been a couple months since I last reached out about your property in [County]. Wanted to see if anything has changed on your end.

Sometimes life shifts — circumstances change, priorities shift, or that land you've been holding onto starts feeling more like a burden than an asset.

If that's happened for you, I'm here. If not, no worries at all.

Hope you're having a great [season].

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 7 — Day 90: The Story

**Subject:** Quick story (thought of you)

Hi [First Name],

I was just working with a landowner in [nearby county] who'd held onto their property for over 15 years. Inherited it from their dad, never did anything with it, paid taxes every year.

They finally decided to sell — not because they had to, but because they realized the land was just sitting there while life was happening.

We closed in three weeks. They used the money to take their grandkids on a trip.

I'm not saying your situation is the same. But it reminded me of you and your property. If you ever want to chat about options, I'm here.

Take care,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 8 — Day 120: The Direct Ask

**Subject:** Honest question

Hey [First Name],

I'll keep this short: Is there any scenario where you'd sell your [County] property this year?

If yes — let's talk. I'll make you a fair offer and we can go from there.

If no — that's okay too. Just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

Appreciate you,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 9 — Day 150: The Empathy Check

**Subject:** I might be way off here

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times now, and I realize I might be completely off base. Maybe you love that property. Maybe you have big plans for it. Maybe you're just not a "sell to some random guy" kind of person.

All fair.

But if I'm wrong — and there's even a small part of you that's thought about selling — I'd genuinely love to hear from you.

What's holding you back?

No judgment, no pitch. Just curious.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 10 — Day 180: The Halfway Mark

**Subject:** 6 months later...

Hey [First Name],

Can you believe it's been six months since I first reached out about your property?

A lot can change in half a year. Jobs, family, priorities. I wanted to check in and see if selling has crossed your mind at all.

If it has — great, let's talk.  
If it hasn't — no worries, I'll check back in a bit.

Either way, I hope you're doing well.

Warmly,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 11 — Day 210: The Light Touch

**Subject:** Still here if you need me

Hi [First Name],

Just a quick note to say I'm still around if you ever want to chat about your [County] land.

No update needed — just wanted you to know the offer to talk still stands.

Take care,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 12 — Day 240: The Tax Season Angle

**Subject:** Tax season thought

Hey [First Name],

With tax season around the corner, I always think about landowners who are paying property taxes on land they're not using.

If that's you — and you've ever wondered what it would look like to turn that tax bill into a check instead — I'm happy to walk you through options.

Just a thought. No pressure.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 13 — Day 270: The Calibrated Question

**Subject:** What would need to change?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out several times now, and I respect that you haven't responded. That tells me something — maybe the timing isn't right, or maybe you're just not interested.

But I'm curious: what would need to change for you to consider selling?

A higher price? Different terms? Just more time?

I'm genuinely asking because I want to understand, not push.

Thanks for reading,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 14 — Day 300: The Family Angle

**Subject:** Thinking ahead

Hey [First Name],

One thing I've learned in this business: land has a way of getting passed down through families, and sometimes that creates more headaches than anyone expected.

If you've ever thought about simplifying things — for yourself or for whoever comes after you — selling might be worth considering.

Just something to think about. I'm here if you want to chat.

Best,  
**Mateo**  
Dirt Roamers

## Email 15 — Day 330: The Honest Closer

**Subject:** I'm not going to keep emailing forever

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out quite a few times this year about your [County] property, and I want to be upfront: this is one of my last emails.

I don't want to be that annoying person in your inbox. But I also don't want you to miss out if selling is something you've been thinking about.

So here's my ask: if there's any chance you'd consider an offer, just reply with "let's talk." That's it.

If not — no hard feelings. I'll close your file and wish you well.

Thanks for your time this year,  
**Mateo & [Wife's Name]**

## Email 16 — Day 365: The Year-End Note

**Subject:** One year later

Hey [First Name],

A full year ago, I first reached out about your property in [County]. Time flies.

This is my last scheduled email to you. I wanted to say thanks for your patience, even if you never replied. I know I've been persistent.

If you ever decide to sell — whether it's next month or five years from now — I hope you'll think of us. We're just a husband and wife who help people with land. That's it.

Wishing you and yours a great year ahead.

All the best,  
**Mateo & [Wife's Name]**
