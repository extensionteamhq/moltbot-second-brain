# Seller Financing Contracts & Note Servicing Guide

*Research Date: 2026-02-17*

---

## Executive Summary

Seller financing is a core profit strategy for Dirt Roamers. This guide covers the essential contracts, terms, and note servicing infrastructure needed to successfully execute seller-financed land deals—both on the acquisition and disposition sides.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Seller Financing Documents

### Key Documents Required

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Purchase Agreement** | Establishes sale terms, price, financing structure |
| **Promissory Note** | Borrower's promise to pay; outlines amount, interest, schedule |
| **Deed of Trust / Mortgage** | Security instrument that liens the property |
| **Land Contract / Contract for Deed** | Alternative structure where seller retains title until payoff |
| **Disclosure Forms** | State-required truth-in-lending disclosures |

### Promissory Note Essentials

A properly drafted promissory note should include:

1. **Principal Amount** — Total loan amount
2. **Interest Rate** — Fixed or adjustable; most land deals use fixed
3. **Payment Schedule** — Monthly amount, due date, payment method
4. **Term Length** — Typically 3-10 years for land
5. **Balloon Payment** — If applicable (common in land deals)
6. **Prepayment Terms** — Penalties or none
7. **Default Provisions** — Late fees, cure periods, foreclosure process
8. **Acceleration Clause** — Allows full balance due upon default

**Sample Clause:**
> "Buyer agrees to make monthly payments of $500 on the first of each month, at an interest rate of 9.9% for a period of 5 years, with a balloon payment of the remaining balance due on Month 60."

### Security Instruments: Deed of Trust vs. Mortgage

| Feature | Deed of Trust | Mortgage |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Parties** | 3 (Borrower, Lender, Trustee) | 2 (Borrower, Lender) |
| **Foreclosure** | Non-judicial (faster) | Judicial (court required) |
| **Common In** | TX, CA, AZ, CO, VA | FL, NY, IL, NJ |
| **Speed to Foreclose** | 60-120 days typical | 6-12+ months |

**For Dirt Roamers' target states:**
- **Deed of Trust states:** NC, TN, GA, MT
- **Mortgage states:** FL, AL, SC

### Contract for Deed (Installment Land Contract)

An alternative to traditional seller financing where:
- Seller retains legal title until full payment
- Buyer gets equitable title and possession
- Simpler to execute, faster to reclaim on default
- **Caution:** Some states have strict regulations protecting buyers

**Pros:** Easier to recover property on default; no foreclosure required in some states
**Cons:** Buyer has limited protections; some states require formal foreclosure anyway

## Part 2: Structuring Seller-Financed Deals

### On the Acquisition Side (Buying from Sellers)

When negotiating seller financing from motivated sellers:

**Ideal Terms to Request:**
- 0% or low interest (5-7%)
- 3-5 year term with balloon
- No prepayment penalty
- 6-12 month forbearance clause (gives time to resell)
- No personal guarantee if possible (LLC takes title)

**Offer at 80-90% of market value** with these terms—justified by convenience and certainty for the seller.

### On the Disposition Side (Selling to Buyers)

When offering seller financing to your buyers:

**Standard Terms:**
- 9.9-12% interest rate (market rate for land)
- 5-10 year amortization
- 20-30% down payment (critical—covers your acquisition cost)
- Monthly payments via ACH (autopay)
- Balloon in 5-7 years

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Cash buyers: 80-95% of market value (discount for cash)
- Seller finance buyers: 100-120% of market value (premium for terms)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Require substantial down payment
- Use professional note servicing
- Record security instrument properly
- Verify buyer can afford payments (basic qualification)

## Part 3: Note Servicing Solutions

### Why Use a Loan Servicer?

Managing payments yourself is time-consuming and error-prone. A professional loan servicer:

- Collects payments automatically (ACH, check, card)
- Tracks loan balances and amortization
- Sends late payment notices
- Issues 1098 interest statements for IRS
- Provides borrower/lender online portals
- Handles default notices

### Recommended Note Servicing Companies

- **Monthly fee:** $15-35 per loan
- **ACH collection:** Often included
- **1098 forms:** Often included

**ROI Calculation:** If you have 10 notes at $25/month = $250/month. Worth it for time saved and professional handling.

### Loan Servicing Software (DIY Option)

| Software | Best For | Website |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Terra Notes** (formerly YourLandLoans) | Land investors specifically | terranotes.com |
| **ZimpleMoney** | Simple payment collection | zimplemoney.com |
| **Loancare Servicing** | Note investors | Various options |

**Recommendation:** Start with a servicing company for first 5-10 notes. Consider software only if scaling significantly and want to reduce costs.

## Part 4: Questions to Ask Loan Servicers

Before signing with a loan servicing company:

1. What states are you licensed in?
2. What's your setup fee and monthly fee per loan?
3. Do you provide online portals for both lender and borrower?
4. What payment methods do you accept from borrowers?
5. How do you handle late payments? (notices, calls, fees)
6. Do you issue 1098 forms for the IRS?
7. Can you split payments between multiple recipients?
8. What's your process if a borrower defaults completely?
9. Do you work with land investors or mainly residential mortgages?
10. What's your average response time for borrower questions?

---

## Part 5: Default & Foreclosure Considerations

### Late Payment Protocol

Standard approach:
1. **Day 1-10:** Grace period (common: 10-15 days)
2. **Day 11-30:** Late fee assessed ($25-50 or 5% of payment)
3. **Day 31+:** Default notice sent
4. **Day 60-90:** Acceleration notice / cure period
5. **Day 90+:** Begin foreclosure or forfeiture process

### Foreclosure by State (Dirt Roamers Markets)

| State | Process | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| **AL** | Judicial/Non-judicial | 60-90 days (non-judicial) | Power of sale if in deed |
| **FL** | Judicial | 6-12 months | Court required |
| **GA** | Non-judicial | 60 days | Must advertise 4 weeks |
| **MT** | Non-judicial | 150 days | Must record properly |
| **NC** | Non-judicial | 60-90 days | Power of sale common |
| **SC** | Judicial | 6-12 months | Court required |
| **TN** | Non-judicial | 45-60 days | Fast process |

**Key Takeaway:** In Deed of Trust states (GA, MT, NC, TN), recovery is faster. In judicial states (FL, SC, AL partial), budget for longer timelines.

## Part 6: Legal & Compliance Considerations

### Dodd-Frank & SAFE Act

For **seller financing on land** (not residential):
- Generally exempt from most Dodd-Frank provisions
- No MLO (Mortgage Loan Originator) license typically required
- Still must comply with state usury laws
- Interest rate caps vary by state

### Usury Laws (Maximum Interest Rates)

| State | Max Rate | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| AL | 8% default; can contract higher | Parties can agree to higher |
| FL | 18% simple / 25% written | Very permissive |
| GA | 7% default; 60% max for some | Complex rules |
| MT | 15% for loans under $300K | Varies by amount |
| NC | 8% default; can contract higher | Written agreements |
| SC | 8.75% default | Legal rate |
| TN | 10% default | Formula-based max |

**Best Practice:** Keep rates between 9-12% for land deals—competitive and safely within limits across all target states.
