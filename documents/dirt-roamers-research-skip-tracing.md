## Recommendation for Dirt Roamers

### Best Overall Value
**Land Portal (Advanced or Pro plan)**

If you're moving to Land Portal for data, using their built-in skip tracing makes sense:
- $0.04-0.05/record is competitive
- No separate tool/login
- Data + skip trace in one flow

### Best for High Volume
**BatchSkipTracing**

If doing 5,000+ traces/month:
- Negotiate volume pricing
- Reliable accuracy
- No subscription lock-in

### Best Budget Option
**123skip.com**

For testing or tight budget:
- $0.07/record is hard to beat
- Try small batch first to verify quality

### Avoid
- **PropStream** — Skip tracing at $0.12/record is expensive; platform is more house-focused
- **REsimpli** — Great CRM but conflicts with GoHighLevel plans

---

## Key Metrics to Track

1. **Hit rate** — % of records returning phone/email
2. **Right-party contact rate** — % of returned numbers that reach actual owner
3. **DNC compliance** — Are numbers scrubbed?
4. **Cost per contact** — Total cost ÷ successful contacts

**Run A/B tests:** Try 200-500 records on two services, compare results.
