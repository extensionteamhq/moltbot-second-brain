### Dirt Roamers — Detailed Strategy

**Target Properties:**
- 5-50 acres (larger parcels for subdivision into 5-10 acre lots)
- Just outside metro areas OR small towns with growth/people moving in
- Areas where people want to build dream homes or homesteads

**Target Sellers:**
- 40+ years old
- Owned land 10+ years
- Inherited via probate
- Tax liens or foreclosure situations

**Acquisition Offers (Two-Option Strategy):**
1. **Cash offer:** 40-50% of market value
2. **Seller financing:** 80-90% of market value (if terms work)

**Exit Strategy:**
- Cash/financed buyers: List at 80-95% market value (instant equity for buyer)
- Seller financing to buyer: 100-120% market value (cash flow play)
- Require 20-30% down from buyer to pay off/reduce acquisition debt

**Long-Term Vision — Homesteading Community:**
- Buy larger parcels, subdivide, place homesteaders on lots
- Self-sufficient community: grow food, raise livestock (chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, cattle)
- Shared responsibilities — families can vacation while others cover
- Revenue streams: seller financing cash flow, produce/eggs/dairy/meat sales, flowers, honey, agritourism (hunting, camping, RV parks)
- Secondary business model after enough flips generate capital (or acquire on seller financing)

**Lead Generation Needs:**
- Data sources for finding land (analytical — areas likely to sell)
- Skip tracing owners (phone, email)
- Pulling deeds/mortgages from county records, scraping owner details
- Multi-touch outreach: calling, texting, email (cheaper than direct mail which had limited success)
- Eventually: AI cold calling

**Current Tools:**
- landinsights.co — sourcing + skip tracing (recently downgraded, limited)
- land.id — supplemental property info
- Zillow + Joe McCall's Dirt Flippers training/strategies

**Tools Under Consideration:**
- landportal.com
- landai.ai — AI cold calling/voice agent (pricey)

**Tech Stack (Planned):**
- GoHighLevel as CRM — calls, texts, emails, newsletters, booking

**Dirt Roamers Resources (Educational Arm):**
- Model after Joe McCall's Dirt Flippers brand
- Build educational materials for aspiring land flippers
- Affiliate programs from tools: land.id, landportal, landai, GoHighLevel (waiting on landinsights)
- Pair affiliate recommendations with bonuses: guides, consultations, GHL snapshots
- Content channels: blog, social media, newsletters
- Revenue: affiliate commissions + digital products

### Mt. Everest (5-Year Vision 2025-2030)

**THE SUMMIT:**
> "By 2030, build a $50M net worth through strategic acquisitions of AI-resistant service businesses and real estate investments, generating $4M+ in annual passive income to fund complete lifestyle freedom — including full-time travel, multiple residences, a private plane, and catamaran — while creating a family office legacy that operates without my daily involvement."
