# Daily Journal - February 7, 2026

## Topics Discussed

### Second Brain Major Overhaul
- Restructured entire tagging system with Category (primary) + Type (secondary) approach
- Categories: Anchor & Staff, Mr Mateo Moore, Dirt Roamers, Rank-n-Soar, Partner With Mateo, Marketing, System, Other
- Types: Guide, Newsletter, SOP, Email Sequence, Script, Notes, Journal, Ideas, Research, Template, Social Media, Framework
- Updated header navigation and sidebar layout
- Established document naming conventions (Clawdbot/Moltbot → Molly)

### Task Management SOP Established
- Created formal workflow: New Task → Clarify → Plan → For Consideration → [Approval] → Research & Plan → [Approval] → Implementing → [Review] → Done
- Key rule: NEVER skip approval checkpoints
- Documented in Second Brain as "Molly: SOP - Task Management"

### Kanban Board Updates
- Renamed "Molly's Recommendations" → "Molly's Tasks"
- Added "Backlog" column
- Created "Mateo's Tasks" board with 8 projects in backlog

### File Audit & Sync
- Added 10 missing documents to Second Brain
- Established daily sync routine for workspace files (AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md)

### Calendar Integration Fix
- Added mateo@anchorandstaff.com to calendar checks
- Now checking all 4 calendars: anchorandstaff, partnerwithmateo, subto, xybermatthew

### Cron Job Updates
- Morning brief: Now focuses on AI tools/models + ClawdHub skills
- Second Brain update: Now includes workspace file sync

## Automated Tasks Executed

### Morning Brief (6 AM ET)
- Sent real estate market news (housing shifting buyer-favorable, homes sitting 64 days avg)
- Sent AI/Tech news (Big Tech $650-700B capex on AI, Anthropic's Cowork AI launch)
- Suggested tasks for Mateo and Molly

### Calendar Check (8 AM ET)
- Sent Saturday calendar: Test Event from Molly (10 AM), Follow-Up with Mateo and Mike (11 AM)
- No SubTo coaching sessions flagged

### Email Inbox Monitoring
- Multiple check attempts failed
- Error: Google OAuth credentials not configured
- Credentials file missing at /home/ubuntu/clawd/.secrets/google-oauth-credentials.json
- Action needed: Re-authenticate with Google OAuth

### Accountability Check-In (6 PM ET)
- Sent brief check-in asking about workout and morning reading/Bible time
- Logged to memory/accountability/2026-02-07.json

### Dirt Roamers Research
- Cron job started GoHighLevel setup research for land investors
- Job was terminated before completion

## Decisions Made

1. **Task Management SOP** - Established formal approval workflow to prevent scope creep and ensure Mateo reviews before major work begins
2. **Tagging System** - Adopted Category + Type dual-tag approach for better document organization
3. **Naming Convention** - Standardized on "Molly" name across all documents (no more Clawdbot/Moltbot)
4. **Daily Sync** - Added workspace file sync to nightly Second Brain update routine

## Action Items

- [ ] Re-authenticate Google OAuth to restore email monitoring
- [ ] Complete GoHighLevel setup research (was interrupted)
- [ ] Continue daily accountability check-ins
- [ ] Monitor Mateo's response to morning briefs for feedback

## Key Insights

1. **Infrastructure matters** - The Second Brain overhaul took significant time but creates a foundation for better knowledge management
2. **Process prevents chaos** - The Task Management SOP ensures nothing gets done without explicit approval
3. **OAuth needs attention** - Email monitoring has been failing consistently; needs manual re-auth

## Summary

A productive Saturday focused primarily on infrastructure and process improvements. The Second Brain received a major overhaul with new tagging, navigation, and organization systems. Established a formal Task Management SOP with clear approval checkpoints. Automated tasks ran throughout the day (morning brief, calendar, accountability check-in), though email monitoring continues to fail due to missing OAuth credentials. The Kanban board now properly separates Molly's tasks from Mateo's, with 8 projects identified in Mateo's backlog. Key lesson: investing in organization and process pays dividends in clarity.
