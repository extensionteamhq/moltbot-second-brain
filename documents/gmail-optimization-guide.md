# Gmail Optimization Guide

Your inbox is now being actively managed by Molly. Here's what's set up and what you can do to make it even better.

## ✅ What's Already Working

### Labels Created
| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 🔥 Hot Leads | Property inquiries, deal opportunities |
| 💼 Business | Clients, partners, business comms |
| 📅 Meetings | Cal.com, calendar notifications |
| 📚 Communities | SubTo, Gator, Skool, Circle |
| 📰 Newsletters | Substacks, marketing emails |
| 🤝 Networking | Blinq, connection requests |
| 🛠️ Tools & Services | Land AI, Read AI, software |
| ⏳ Waiting Response | Emails you're waiting on |
| ✅ Processed | Dealt with, archive later |

### Automated Management (3x daily: 8am, 12pm, 4pm ET)
- Auto-labels and archives newsletters/noise
- Alerts you to hot leads via Telegram
- Summarizes inbox if it gets overwhelming

## 🔧 Manual Filters to Set Up

The API can't create filters, but you can set these up in 2 minutes:

**Go to:** Gmail → Settings (⚙️) → See all settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create new filter

### High-Priority Filters

**1. Archive Duplicate Spammer**
- From: `clara@colivingcashflow.com`
- Action: Skip Inbox, Apply label "📰 Newsletters"

**2. Archive Aggressive Promo**
- From: `rachel@powerpathwayshelm.org`
- Action: Skip Inbox, Apply label "📰 Newsletters"

**3. Archive Blinq Noise**
- From: `noreply@blinq.me`

- Action: Apply label "📅 Meetings"

**6. Auto-label SubTo**
- From: `@subto.com`
- Action: Apply label "📚 Communities"

## 📊 Recommended Unsubscribes

Based on your inbox analysis, these send frequent low-value emails:
- clara@colivingcashflow.com (duplicate sender)
- rachel@powerpathwayshelm.org (spam tactics)
- Any "daily digest" you never read

## 🎯 How to Use This System

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning:** Check 🔥 Hot Leads first
2. **Then:** Scan 💼 Business and 📅 Meetings
3. **Weekly:** Review 📰 Newsletters (batch read or unsubscribe)

### Processing Emails
- Reply → Move to ⏳ Waiting Response
- Done with it → Apply ✅ Processed, then archive
- Important reference → Star it

### When I Alert You
- New hot leads detected
- Inbox exceeds 50 unread after cleanup
- Urgent-looking business emails

## 📈 Expected Results

- **50-70% less noise** in primary inbox
- **Hot leads surfaced** instead of buried
- **3x daily cleanup** keeps things tidy
- **Alerts only when needed** — not spam
