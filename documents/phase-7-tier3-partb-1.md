Payment Calculation Formula
Monthly Payment (PMT):


PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]


Where:


P = Principal ($60,000)


r = Monthly interest rate (0.008333)


n = Number of payments (18)


PMT = 60,000 × [0.008333(1.008333)^18] / [(1.008333)^18 - 1]


PMT = 60,000 × [0.008333 × 1.160541] / [1.160541 - 1]


PMT = 60,000 × 0.009671 / 0.160541


PMT = 60,000 × 0.060248


PMT = $3,614.88 (rounded to $3,615)

Interest vs. Principal Breakdown
Year 1 (Months 1-12):


* Total Payments: $43,380
* Principal Paid: $39,384 (65.6% of original loan)
* Interest Paid: $3,996 (78.8% of total interest)
* Remaining Balance: $20,874


Year 2 (Months 13-18):


* Total Payments: $21,690
* Principal Paid: $20,616 (34.4% of original loan)
* Interest Paid: $1,074 (21.2% of total interest)
* Remaining Balance: $0


Key Insight: Most interest is paid in the first year while balance is higher. Accelerated principal paydown in later months as interest portion decreases.

DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO (DSCR)
DSCR Definition & Formula
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) measures ability to service debt from operating income.


Formula:


DSCR = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service


Where:


Net Operating Income (NOI) = Revenue - Operating Expenses - Variable Costs


Total Debt Service = Monthly payment ($3,615)


Lender Standards:


* DSCR < 1.0 = Cannot cover debt (high risk)
* DSCR = 1.0 = Break-even (marginal)
* DSCR = 1.25 = Minimum acceptable (most lenders)
* DSCR = 1.5+ = Comfortable coverage
* DSCR = 2.0+ = Strong coverage

Analysis:


* Break-even DSCR (1.0): Between Months 10-11
* Comfortable DSCR (1.5+): Month 12 onwards
* Target DSCR (2.0+): Month 13 onwards
* Final DSCR: 2.82x (strong debt coverage)

Interpretation:


* Expected scenario: Strong DSCR throughout loan term
* Conservative scenario: Marginal in early months, acceptable by end
* Optimistic scenario: Excellent coverage from Month 11 onwards
* All scenarios achieve 1.25+ DSCR by loan maturity

DSCR Sensitivity Analysis
Impact of Revenue Variations (Month 18):


Revenue Level
	NOI
	DSCR
	Debt Coverage
	$8,000/month
	$5,390
	1.49
	Acceptable
	$10,000/month
	$7,700
	2.13
	Strong
	$13,000/month
	$10,190
	2.82
	Excellent
	$15,000/month
	$12,130
	3.36
	Exceptional
	$18,000/month
	$15,040
	4.16
	Outstanding
	

Minimum Revenue for 1.25x DSCR:


Required NOI = 1.25 × $3,615 = $4,519


Required Revenue = $4,519 + $600 + (clients × $170)


At 10 clients:


Required Revenue = $4,519 + $600 + $1,700 = $6,819/month


= 6.8 clients at $1,000/month


Conclusion: Minimum 6.8 clients needed for acceptable DSCR

Lender Advantages:


* Higher return than traditional fixed income
* Lower risk than equity investments
* Asset-backed security (websites have resale value)
* Experienced operator (reduces default risk)
* Short term (18 months vs. 5-10 year bonds)
* No prepayment penalty (can get principal back early if business excels)


________________


Risk Assessment for Lender
Default Risk Factors:


Low Risk:


* ✓ Experienced operator (24 years tech, 10+ years marketing)
* ✓ Conservative financial projections
* ✓ Diversified portfolio (10+ sites reduces single point of failure)
* ✓ Asset-backed (websites worth $250K-$350K by maturity)
* ✓ Multiple revenue scenarios planned
* ✓ $10K emergency reserve built into loan


Medium Risk:


* ~ SEO timeline uncertainty (could take 9 months vs. 6)
* ~ Market competition (more operators entering space)
* ~ Google algorithm changes (ranking volatility)


Mitigation:


* Conservative assumptions account for delays
* Strong DSCR even in conservative scenario (1.62x at Month 18)
* Asset value exceeds loan by 4-6x at maturity
* Business can continue operating even if loan defaults (assets remain)


Estimated Default Probability: <5% Loss Given Default: Low (can sell portfolio to recover principal) Expected Loss: <2% of principal

Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio
Traditional LTV (based on asset value):


Timeframe
	Loan Balance
	Asset Value
	LTV Ratio
	Month 0
	$60,000
	$10,000
	600% (high)
	Month 6
	$40,918
	$25,000
	164%
	Month 12
	$20,874
	$100,000
	21%
	Month 18
	$0
	$390,000
	0%
	

Analysis:


* Initial LTV high (startup phase, assets still being built)
* Rapid improvement as sites rank and generate revenue
* By Month 12, LTV below 25% (very safe)
* Loan fully repaid by Month 18 with substantial asset cushion


Conservative Asset Valuation (for LTV):


* Unranked sites: $1,000 each (development cost)
* Ranking sites (no revenue): $5,000 each (traffic value)
* Monetized sites: 25x monthly revenue (conservative vs. 30-35x market rate)

Prepayment Analysis
Prepayment Option: No penalty for early repayment


Scenarios Where Prepayment Likely:


* Business exceeds projections (Optimistic scenario)
* Owner receives windfall or additional capital
* Wants to reduce interest expense
* Preparing for business sale


Example Prepayment Scenario (Optimistic):


If Prepaid At
	Months Early
	Interest Saved
	Total Paid
	Total Saved
	Month 15
	3 months
	$291

	$677
	Month 9
	9 months
	$1,176
	$63,894
	$1,176
	

Lender Impact: Receives principal back early, can redeploy capital sooner

COMPARATIVE LOAN ANALYSIS
Alternative Financing Options (Not Chosen)
Option 1: Traditional Bank Loan


* Amount: $60,000
* Rate: 6-8% (better rate)
* Term: 3-5 years
* Rejected because: Difficult to qualify (startup, no revenue), requires collateral, slower approval


Option 2: SBA Loan


* Amount: Up to $500,000
* Rate: 7-9%
* Term: 5-10 years
* Rejected because: Lengthy application (3-6 months), extensive paperwork, startup restrictions


Option 3: Personal Credit Cards


* Amount: $20,000-50,000 (typical limits)
* Rate: 15-25% APR
* Term: Revolving
* Rejected because: High interest, not suitable for business capital, personal liability


Option 4: Online Lender (OnDeck, Kabbage)


* Amount: $5,000-$250,000
* Rate: 15-30% APR
* Term: 6-24 months
* Rejected because: Extremely expensive, predatory terms, daily payments


Option 5: Business Line of Credit


* Amount: $10,000-$100,000
* Rate: 8-12%
* Term: Revolving
* Rejected because: Difficult to qualify without revenue, variable rates risky


Chosen Option: Private Money Lending


* Pros: Fast approval, relationship-based, flexible terms, reasonable rate
* Cons: Shorter term than bank, slightly higher rate than traditional
* Why Best: Ideal for experienced operator with strong plan but no track record yet


________________




The loan structure provides fair value to both lender (competitive returns with reasonable risk) and borrower (access to capital with manageable payments and no prepayment penalty).
