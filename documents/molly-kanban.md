# Projects Kanban Board

## For Consideration
*Tasks Molly recommends — awaiting Mateo's review*

- [ ] **Cloudflare Tunnel Setup - Secure Dashboard Access** — Set up Cloudflare Tunnel to access Clawdbot dashboard (currently on port 18789) securely without exposing to public internet. Change port to something less common (suggestion: 37842). Provides authenticated web access from anywhere. (Added: 2026-02-12)
  
  **Mateo's Tasks:**
  - [ ] Create free Cloudflare account (if don't have one): https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
  - [ ] Decide: Use subdomain on existing domain OR use Cloudflare's provided URL (e.g., `molly-dashboard.trycloudflare.com`)
  - [ ] If using own domain: Add domain to Cloudflare account + update nameservers
  - [ ] Review and approve tunnel configuration before going live
  - [ ] Test dashboard access from phone + laptop after setup
  
  **Molly's Tasks:**
  - [ ] Change Clawdbot dashboard port from 18789 to 37842 (less common, harder to scan)
  - [ ] Install cloudflared on server
  - [ ] Configure tunnel with authentication (Cloudflare Access or password)
  - [ ] Set up tunnel routing to dashboard
  - [ ] Test connectivity and security
  - [ ] Document access instructions (URL, auth method, troubleshooting)
  - [ ] Create quick-start guide for Mateo

- [ ] **Dirt Roamers Email Sequence** — Draft a 5-email nurture sequence for land sellers (cold outreach → follow-up → offer). Ready to load into GoHighLevel. (Added: 2026-02-07)

- [ ] **Land Tool Comparison Report** — Compile research on landportal.com, landai.ai, land.id, and landinsights.co into a decision matrix with pricing, features, affiliate programs, and recommendations. (Added: 2026-02-07)

- [ ] **Social Media Content Calendar** — Build a 30-day content calendar template for Twitter/X and LinkedIn with post ideas aligned to Dirt Roamers + Anchor & Staff brand positioning. (Added: 2026-02-07)
