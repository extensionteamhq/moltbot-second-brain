# Brand Voice Style Guide
## Client Intake Questionnaire

Complete this questionnaire so we can build a comprehensive Brand Voice Style Guide tailored to your company.

**Please answer every question as thoroughly as possible. The more detail you provide, the sharper your guide will be.**

---

## Part 1: Company Basics

Let's start with the fundamentals. This section helps us understand what your company does, who it serves, and why it exists.

### Q1. Company name (exactly as it should appear in all communications):

---

### Q2. What does your company do? Describe your products, services, or offerings in plain language.

Be specific. Don't just say "we're a marketing agency." Tell us what you actually do, for whom, and how. The more concrete, the better.

---

### Q3. Who is your target customer? Describe them in detail.

Think about demographics, psychographics, lifestyle, and situation. What are they dealing with when they come to you? What do they need? What's their day-to-day like?

---

### Q4. What problem do you solve? What does life look like before and after working with you?

Describe the pain points, frustrations, or challenges your customer faces—and what changes once you've helped them. Be specific about the transformation.

---

### Q5. What's your origin story? How and why was the company started?

Who founded it? When? What was the motivation? This helps us capture the human element behind the brand.

---

## Part 2: Brand Personality

### Q7. List 3–5 adjectives that describe your brand's personality.

If your brand walked into a room, how would people describe it? Examples: confident, quirky, rugged, warm, rebellious, polished, nerdy, calm, bold, playful, trustworthy.

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

### Q8. Which brand archetype best represents your company's role? (Check one)

Choose the archetype that best describes the role your brand plays in your customer's life. Don't overthink it—go with your gut.

- [ ] **The Sage** — Wisdom, knowledge, expertise (consultants, educators)
- [ ] **The Hero** — Courage, achievement, transformation (fitness, coaching)
- [ ] **The Caregiver** — Nurturing, service, protection (healthcare, nonprofits)
- [ ] **The Creator** — Innovation, imagination, vision (design, technology)

**Optional:** explain why you chose this archetype, or describe your brand's role in your own words:

---

### Q9. If your brand were a person at a party, how would people describe them?

Paint a picture. How do they act? What do they talk about? How do they make people feel? Are they the life of the party or the trusted advisor in the corner? This is one of the most important questions—take your time.

---

### Q10. Name a celebrity, public figure, or fictional character whose vibe matches your brand.

This is a shortcut to personality. Who "sounds like" your brand? It could be an actor, a TV character, a historical figure, a YouTuber—anyone. Feel free to list 2–3 options and explain why each fits.

---

## Part 3: Voice & Tone

Your voice stays the same everywhere. Your tone adjusts by context—like how you'd talk differently to a friend vs. a client, but you're still you.

### Q11. Where does your brand fall on the formality spectrum? (Check one)

- [ ] **Very casual** — Like texting a friend. Slang is fine. First names always.
- [ ] **Casual-professional** — Relaxed but credible. Conversational, not sloppy.
- [ ] **Professional with personality** — Polished and warm. Approachable but buttoned-up.
- [ ] **Mostly formal** — Authoritative, serious, premium. Corporate polish.

### Q12. Rate your brand on each of these spectrums.

Write a percentage showing where you fall. For example, "30% formal" means you lean more casual. Add notes to explain your reasoning.

| Spectrum | Your Position | Notes / Explanation |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | ____% | |
| Serious ↔ Playful | ____% | |
| Reserved ↔ Enthusiastic | ____% | |
| Technical ↔ Simple | ____% | |
| Traditional ↔ Modern | ____% | |

### Q13. Does your brand use humor? (Check one)

- [ ] **Yes** — We use humor a lot. It's core to who we are.
- [ ] **Sometimes** — Light humor where it fits, but we're not comedians.
- [ ] **Rarely** — We're more earnest and sincere. Humor feels off-brand.
- [ ] **Depends on the channel** — Funny on social, serious in sales.

**Optional:** describe how humor shows up (or doesn't) in your brand:

---

### Q14. Pick 1–2 personality vibes that feel most like your brand:

- [ ] Rugged and adventurous
- [ ] Warm and community-driven
- [ ] Witty and irreverent
- [ ] Calm and inspiring
- [ ] Bold and disruptive
- [ ] Polished and premium
- [ ] Nerdy and detail-oriented
- [ ] Friendly and approachable
- [ ] Other: ________________________________

## Part 4: Language & Opinions

This section helps us understand your brand's vocabulary, boundaries, and the topics where you take a stand.

### Q15. What topics does your brand have strong opinions on?

What hills would your brand die on? What do you believe that others in your industry might disagree with? These opinions become the backbone of your content voice.

---

### Q16. What does your brand never joke about or take lightly?

Every brand has boundaries. What topics are always treated with seriousness and respect? What would be off-brand to make light of?

---

### Q17. Are there specific words or phrases your brand loves to use?

Think about words that show up naturally in your team's conversations, your website, or your sales calls. Signature phrases, insider language, or terms of art you've adopted.

---

### Q18. Are there words or phrases your brand actively avoids?

Corporate jargon? Industry buzzwords? Specific terms that feel off-brand? Words your competitors overuse that you want to steer clear of?

---

### Q19. How would your brand deliver bad news to a customer?

Imagine something went wrong—a delay, a mistake, a price increase. How would your brand handle it? This reveals a lot about voice and values.

---

## Part 5: Competitive Positioning

Understanding how you're different helps us make your voice distinctive in the market.

### Q20. Who are your top 2–3 competitors? How is your voice or approach different from theirs?

---

### Q21. What do customers say they love about communicating with you?

Think about compliments, testimonials, or feedback you've received. What do people say about your tone, your emails, your sales calls, your content? Direct quotes are gold.

---

### Q22. What would make someone immediately recognize a message as coming from your brand?

If someone saw a social post, email, or ad with no logo, what would tip them off that it's yours? A certain phrase? A tone? An attitude? A format?

---

## Part 6: Examples & References

Real examples make the best style guides. Share anything that shows your voice in action—or shows the voice you want to grow into.

### Q23. Share 2–3 pieces of existing content that feel "most like us."

These can be social posts, emails, blog articles, ad copy, sales scripts—anything. Paste them below or attach them separately. Tell us why each one feels right.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Why it feels right:**

**Example 3:**

**Why it feels right:**

### Q24. Share 1–2 pieces of content that feel "not like us" (from your own brand or others).

**Anti-example 1:**

**What feels off:**

**Anti-example 2:**

**What feels off:**

### Q25. Are there any other brands (in any industry) whose voice you admire?

This doesn't mean you want to copy them—just that something about how they communicate resonates with you. Tell us what you admire about each.

---

## Part 7: Anything Else

### Q26. Is there anything else we should know about your brand, your voice, or your communication goals?

Anything that didn't fit neatly into the questions above. Context about your industry, your team culture, upcoming changes, or specific challenges you're facing with brand consistency.
