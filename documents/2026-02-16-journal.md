## Decisions Made

- Continue running automated email inbox management daily
- Morning briefs format working well with AI news + task recommendations
- Accountability check-ins established at 8:30pm ET

## Action Items

- [ ] Clean up expired cron job (email-inbox-monitor-night) when gateway responsive
- [ ] Track Mateo's accountability responses for workout/Bible time
- [ ] Continue monitoring Trello boards for task status changes

## Key Insights

1. **Email inbox is well-maintained** — Only 8 unread, auto-cleanup effective
2. **Clear calendar days** are good for deep work — note for future planning
3. **Gateway timeouts** happening occasionally — may need monitoring
4. **Zero-click search** trend important for Rank-n-Soar SEO strategy

## Summary

Quiet but productive Monday. Morning brief delivered with relevant AI/marketing news. Calendar was clear except for morning workout. Email inbox stayed clean. Created two new Dirt Roamers research docs (GHL workflows, buyer list building). Evening accountability check-in sent. System maintenance attempted but hit gateway timeouts — will retry cleanup later.
