# Daily Brief — Thursday, February 19th, 2026

## 📰 AI Tools & Models

### Real Estate AI Gets Serious

**Lofty AOS — First Agentic AI Operating System for Real Estate** — Unlike typical CRM add-ons, Lofty AOS takes ownership of core workflows: lead follow-up, appointment scheduling, transaction coordination. It runs autonomously toward outcomes, not just responds to prompts. Worth watching for Dirt Roamers' future tech stack.

**Top Producer Smart Targeting** — Proprietary AI identifies the top 20% of likely sellers in your farm area. Could be valuable for land acquisition — identifies motivated sellers before they list. Integrates with their existing CRM.

## 🤖 Task Recommendations

**1. Evaluate Top Producer Smart Targeting for Land Acquisition**
The AI-powered seller identification could complement your existing lead gen. I can research pricing, integration with GoHighLevel, and whether it works for vacant land (not just homes).

**2. Create "AI Tools for Land Investors" Resource**
Given the new tools emerging, this could be valuable content for Dirt Roamers Resources — helps with SEO and establishes authority while generating affiliate opportunities.
