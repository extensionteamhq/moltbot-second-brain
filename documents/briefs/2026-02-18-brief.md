# Daily Brief — Wednesday, February 18th, 2026

## 📰 AI Tools & Models

### New Developer Tools

**Kimi Code Debuts (#4 in AI Dev Power Rankings)** — Moonshot's companion to Kimi K2.5 brings open-source agentic coding to the terminal. Integrates with VSCode, Cursor, and Zed. Worth exploring given you're already using Kimi for cost savings — this could streamline dev work.

**Mistral Voxtral Transcribe 2** — Sub-200ms realtime transcription with open weights. Huge for anyone doing AI cold calling or voice workflows — could be a better alternative to expensive closed APIs.

### Marketing Automation Updates

**Surfer SEO's "AI Tracker"** — New 2026 feature that monitors how often your site gets cited in AI search results (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.). Critical for LLM SEO strategy — exactly what Rank N Soar needs.

## 🤖 Task Recommendations

**1. Research Kimi Code for Dev Workflow**
Since you're already using Kimi K2 for cost savings, I can evaluate Kimi Code's terminal-based agentic coding to see if it could speed up Rank N Soar template development.

**2. Explore AI Tracker for LLM SEO**
Surfer's new AI citation tracking could be valuable intelligence for Rank N Soar's positioning strategy. I can research how to optimize for AI search visibility.
