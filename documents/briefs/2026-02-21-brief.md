# Daily Brief — Saturday, February 21st, 2026

## 📰 AI Tools & Models

### Claude Sonnet 4.6 Released

**Big upgrade for your stack.** Anthropic dropped Sonnet 4.6 this week with major improvements in coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, and agent planning. It now handles tasks that previously required Opus-class models. Same pricing as 4.5 ($3/$15 per 1M tokens) with a 1M context window in beta. This is now the default on claude.ai.

Worth noting for Clawdbot: better agent planning = potentially smarter sub-agents for research tasks.

### Gemini 3.1 Pro Now Available

**Google's reasoning upgrade.** Gemini 3.1 Pro hit preview in Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and the Gemini app. Google claims it more than doubled reasoning performance vs 3 Pro on ARC-AGI-2 benchmarks (77.1% vs prior). Available in Android Studio and NotebookLM too.

### Microsoft's Pre-Built VS Code Agents

**Developer workflow automation.** Microsoft shipped specialized agents for Visual Studio: Debugger (works through call stacks/errors), Profiler (finds bottlenecks), Test (generates unit tests), and Modernize (executes framework upgrades). Accessible via @ mention in the chat panel.

For your dev work: these could speed up debugging and test coverage on Next.js projects.

## 🤖 Task Recommendations

**1. Update Clawdbot to Sonnet 4.6**
Since 4.6 is same price as 4.5 with better performance, I can update the model config once Anthropic pushes it to the API. Will monitor availability.

**2. Continue Implementing Tasks**
