# Daily Brief — Friday, February 20th, 2026

## 📰 AI Tools & Models

### Meta Embeds Manus AI into Ads Manager

**Big move for paid advertising.** Meta is integrating Manus AI directly into Ads Manager, giving advertisers built-in AI tools to streamline reporting, research, and campaign optimization. No more jumping between tools — AI-powered insights native to your ad workflow. For Anchor & Staff clients running Meta ads, this could significantly reduce campaign management overhead.

Bookmarkable for quick model comparisons when evaluating cost vs. capability.

### Tidio AI for Customer Engagement

**Conversational commerce automation.** Tidio combines live chat, AI chatbots, and help desk into one platform — auto-responding to inquiries, delivering personalized product recommendations, and tracking user behavior. Could be worth evaluating for Dirt Roamers' buyer engagement or Anchor & Staff client lead capture.
