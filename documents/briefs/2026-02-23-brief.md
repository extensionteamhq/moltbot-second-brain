## 📰 AI Tools & Models

### Google + Shopee: AI Agentic Shopping on the Horizon

**Autonomous shopping AI.** Google and Sea Ltd (Shopee's parent) signed a strategic partnership to build an "AI agentic shopping prototype" for Shopee's e-commerce platform. The system would handle end-to-end shopping tasks autonomously — browsing, comparing, purchasing. Early signal of where AI-powered commerce is heading.
