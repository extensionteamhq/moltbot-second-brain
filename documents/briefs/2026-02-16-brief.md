## 🤖 TASK RECOMMENDATIONS

**1. Zero-Click Search Strategy Document for Rank-n-Soar**
With zero-click expanding beyond Google to AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.), I can research and document how to optimize Rank-n-Soar sites for LLM visibility — structured data, FAQ schemas, and content patterns that get cited by AI assistants.

**2. AI Marketing Tools Comparison Matrix**
Create a reference sheet comparing top AI marketing automation tools (features, pricing, best-for use cases) that Anchor & Staff can use when recommending solutions to clients.

*Reply "yes" to either and I'll add to Trello under For Consideration.*
