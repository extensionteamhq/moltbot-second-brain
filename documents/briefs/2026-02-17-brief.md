# Daily Brief — Tuesday, February 17th, 2026

## 📰 AI Tools & Models

### AI Agents & Automation (New This Week)

**Monday.com AI Agents** — Two new purpose-built agents worth knowing:
- **Odin AI Analyst** — Answers complex business questions in natural language, generates automated reports (89% accuracy claimed)
- **Nova AI Sales Agent** — Prioritizes high-intent accounts, builds stakeholder maps, orchestrates workflows across sales tools

**Claude Cowork (Desktop App)** — Built into Claude's desktop app, executes multi-step workflows across files and tools without writing code. Good for non-technical automation.

## 🤖 Task Recommendations

**1. AI Agent Comparison for Anchor & Staff**
I can create a comparison matrix of AI agent platforms (Monday.com, Claude Cowork, custom solutions) for client recommendations. Would help position the agency as AI-savvy.

## 💭 Thought

*"Automation is not about replacing people—it's about freeing them to do what machines can't."*
