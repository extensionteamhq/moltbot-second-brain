## 🧩 New ClawdHub Skills

*Site unavailable for detailed content extraction. Will check again tomorrow.*

## 🤖 Task Recommendations

**1. Update AI Model Configuration**
Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex dropped February 5th. I can research pricing, capabilities, and whether these should be added to your Clawdbot configuration. Would create a comparison doc with recommendations.

**2. Create "AI Tools for Agencies" Resource Doc**
Based on the Synthesia article's top AI tools, I can compile a curated list of tools relevant to Anchor & Staff's consulting work — meeting tools, presentation builders, content creators. Useful for client recommendations and affiliate opportunities.

## 💭 Thought

*The landscape shifts fast — but you don't have to chase every update. Pick the tools that compound, not the ones that distract.*
