## Section 1: Brand Personality

### 1.1 Brand Personality Traits

These five traits define the Dirt Roamers character. Every piece of communication should reflect at least one.

| Trait | What It Means | What It Doesn't Mean |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Rugged** | We're connected to the land, unafraid to get our boots dirty, and built for the real world. | Not aggressive, intimidating, or exclusionary |
| **Down-to-Earth** | We speak plainly, keep things simple, and treat people like real humans—not transactions. | Not unsophisticated or careless |
| **Trustworthy** | We do what we say. No hidden fees, no bait-and-switch, no pressure tactics. | Not boring or overly cautious |
| **Adventurous** | We see every piece of land as possibility. We're explorers at heart. | Not reckless or flighty |
| **Warm** | We genuinely care about the people we work with and the outcomes they get. | Not soft, wishy-washy, or over-the-top sentimental |

### 1.2 Brand Archetype: The Explorer

**Dirt Roamers is *The Explorer*.** We represent freedom, discovery, and the open road. Our role in the customer's journey is to be the trusted guide who removes obstacles and opens up new possibilities—whether that's helping a landowner finally unload a burdensome property or teaching someone how to build wealth through land investing.

The Explorer archetype shows up in our name ("Dirt Roamers"—we literally roam the dirt), our adventurous spirit, and our belief that the best opportunities are found off the beaten path.

### 1.3 Brand Character Statement

> If Dirt Roamers were a person, they'd be the rugged adventurer who's surprisingly down-to-earth and always ready with a practical solution. Think Sam Elliott energy—weathered, trustworthy, calm, connected to the land. They're the friend who's traveled every backroad in the country, has stories for days, but never brags. When you tell them about your land headache, they listen carefully, cut through the noise, and quietly offer a fair, fast way forward—no hard sell, no drama. When you talk to them, you feel understood and relieved. They never make you feel pressured or foolish, and they always leave you with a clear path forward.

## Section 2: Voice Attributes

### 2.1 Voice Attribute Spectrum

Where Dirt Roamers falls on key communication spectrums:

| Spectrum | Our Position | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | 35% formal | Relaxed but credible. We use contractions, conversational language, and first names. Never stiff or corporate. |
| Serious ↔ Playful | 65% serious | We're solving real problems for real people. But we're not stuffy—light humor is welcome, especially on social media. |
| Reserved ↔ Enthusiastic | 55% enthusiastic | Genuinely energized about land and helping people, without sounding like an infomercial. |
| Technical ↔ Simple | 20% technical | Plain English, always. If a landowner wouldn't use the word, neither do we. |
| Traditional ↔ Modern | 60% modern | Contemporary and current, but grounded. We're not chasing trends—we're rooted. |

### 2.2 Voice Do's and Don'ts

#### ✅ DO:

- Use "you" and "your" to speak directly to the reader
- Use active voice ("We buy land" not "Land is purchased by us")
- Keep sentences short and punchy when possible
- Lead with the benefit to the landowner, not our process
- Acknowledge the emotional weight of selling property—it's often tied to family, memories, or stress
- Be specific: "Cash offer in 24–48 hours" beats "fast offers"
- Use real-world, relatable language ("we handle the paperwork" not "we facilitate transactional documentation")
- End with a clear next step or call to action

#### ❌ DON'T:

- Use corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "optimize your portfolio")
- Use high-pressure sales tactics or artificial urgency
- Overpromise ("guaranteed highest price"—we can't guarantee that)
- Talk down to landowners or assume they don't understand their own property
- Be negative about realtors or traditional sales methods (just focus on our value)
- Use excessive exclamation points or ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Sound desperate or needy ("Please sell to us!")
- Use industry jargon without explanation (title search, easement, due diligence, etc.—explain or simplify)

## Section 3: Tone Variations

Our voice stays consistent, but our tone adjusts based on context—just like a real person. Think of it this way: Sam Elliott sounds the same whether he's telling a campfire story or explaining a problem, but the energy and warmth shift.

### 3.1 Tone by Context

| Context | Tone Adjustment | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Website homepage** | Confident, reassuring, clear | "We buy land. Fast cash. No hassle. It's that simple." |
| **Blog post** | Educational, helpful, laid-back | "Let's break down what happens when you inherit land you don't want..." |
| **Social media (Instagram/TikTok)** | Conversational, punchy, visual | "This 10-acre parcel in Colorado wasn't doing anything for anyone. Until it did." |
| **Social media (LinkedIn/Facebook)** | Credible, story-driven, community-focused | "Another landowner taken care of. Here's what we learned along the way." |
| **Email to seller** | Personal, empathetic, straightforward | "Hey [Name], I saw your property in [County]. If you've been thinking about selling, I'd love to make you a fair cash offer..." |
| **Email newsletter** | Warm, valuable, insider-knowledge | "This week from the road: three things we're seeing in the land market right now..." |
| **Sales conversation** | Consultative, honest, no-pressure | "Here's what we can offer. Take your time—no rush on our end." |
| **Customer support** | Empathetic, helpful, solution-first | "I hear you. Let me look into this and get it sorted." |
| **Error or bad news** | Honest, accountable, forward-looking | "We hit a snag with the title. Here's what's happening and what we're doing about it." |
| **Celebration** | Enthusiastic, grateful, grounded | "Another deal closed, another landowner taken care of. This is why we do what we do." |

### 3.2 Emotional Range

| Emotion | When We Express It | How We Express It |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Empathy** | Seller is stressed, overwhelmed, or grieving (inherited land) | "We get it. Dealing with property you didn't ask for is exhausting." (acknowledging, never pitying) |
| **Confidence** | Making offers, describing our process, positioning ourselves | "Here's what we do, and we do it well." (authoritative but never arrogant) |
| **Excitement** | Closing deals, exploring new land, community wins | "This is why we roam." (grounded excitement, not over-the-top) |
| **Gratitude** | When a seller chooses us, community milestones | "We don't take your trust lightly. Thank you." (specific, not generic) |
| **Urgency** | Time-sensitive situations only (tax deadlines, etc.) | "Your tax deadline is coming up. Let's get this handled." (factual stakes, never manipulative) |

## Section 4: Language Guidelines

### 4.1 Vocabulary & Terminology

#### Words We Use:

| Instead of... | We Say... | Why |
|---------------|-----------|-----|
| Property acquisition | Buying land | Plain English. Nobody talks like that. |
| Seller | Landowner | Respects their relationship to the property |
| Transaction | Deal / agreement | Less corporate, more human |
| Compensation | Cash offer / payment | Clear and concrete |
| Distressed property | Unwanted or unused land | No judgment—just reality |
| Expedited closing | Close on your timeline | Puts the power in their hands |
| Capital | Cash | Straightforward |
| Due diligence | Our research / homework | Avoids jargon |
| Subject property | Your land / your property | Personal, not clinical |

#### Words & Phrases We Avoid:

| Word/Phrase | Why We Avoid It |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "We'll take it off your hands" | Sounds dismissive of the property's value |
| "This won't last long" | Artificial urgency / pressure tactic |
| "As-is condition" | Sounds like we're settling; we say "any condition" |
| "No-brainer" | Condescending—let the landowner decide for themselves |
| "Guaranteed" (for price or outcomes) | Overpromises what we can control |
| "Synergy / leverage / optimize" | Corporate buzzwords that erode trust |
| "To be honest..." | Implies we're not honest otherwise |
| "Just reaching out" | Vague and passive—be direct about why you're contacting them |
| "URGENT / ACT NOW" | Spam energy. We don't pressure people. |

### 4.2 Grammar & Mechanics

| Element | Our Standard | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Contractions** | Yes, always use them | "We're here to help" not "We are here to help" |
| **Oxford comma** | Yes, always | "Cash, speed, and simplicity" |
| **Capitalization** | Sentence case for headlines | "How to sell your land fast" not "How To Sell Your Land Fast" |
| **Numbers** | Spell out one through nine; numerals for 10+ | "Three easy steps" but "15 acres" |
| **Exclamation points** | Max one per piece of content | Save for genuine excitement or celebration |
| **Emoji** | Platform-appropriate | Social media and casual emails: yes. Formal proposals or contracts: no. |
| **Ampersands (&)** | Only in proper names if applicable | "Cash and simplicity" not "Cash & simplicity" |
| **Ellipses (...)** | Sparingly, for conversational pauses | "You know that land sitting empty? Yeah, we can fix that." |
| **Dashes (—)** | For emphasis and asides | "No commissions. No fees. No hassle—just cash." |

### 4.3 Naming Conventions

| Element | Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Company name | Dirt Roamers | DirtRoamers, Dirt roamers, DR |
| First reference in any piece | Dirt Roamers | The company, The firm, The team |
| Subsequent references | Dirt Roamers, we, our team, us | They, it, the company |

## Section 5: Messaging Framework

### 5.1 Tagline & Positioning Statement

**Tagline:**

> "Your Land. Your Terms. Fast Cash."

**Positioning Statement:**

> For landowners who want to sell vacant property quickly and without hassle, Dirt Roamers is the land buying company that makes fair cash offers in 24–48 hours and closes on your timeline—no realtors, no commissions, no drama—because we believe selling your land should be as simple as deciding to do it.

### 5.2 Core Messages

These messages should appear consistently across all communications:

| Message | Supporting Points | When to Use |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| "Selling land shouldn't be this hard." | Traditional sales are slow, expensive, and stressful. We exist to fix that. | Website, seller outreach, advertising—anytime we introduce who we are |
| "Fair cash offer. 24–48 hours." | Speed without sacrificing fairness. No waiting months for a buyer. | Website, direct mail, email, social ads |
| "We handle everything." | No commissions, no fees, we cover closing costs and do the paperwork. | Sales conversations, FAQs, objection handling |
| "Your timeline, not ours." | Flexible closing. The landowner is in control. | Differentiating from high-pressure buyers |
| "More than a land company—a community." | Investors, adventurers, educators. Built on values and lifestyle. | About page, newsletter, community-building content |

### 5.3 Elevator Pitches

**"What does Dirt Roamers do?"**

> We buy vacant land directly from landowners for cash. Fair offer, usually within 24–48 hours. We handle the paperwork, cover closing costs, and close on your timeline. No realtors, no commissions, no headaches.

**"Who do you work with?"**

> Mostly everyday landowners—people who've inherited property, folks dealing with taxes on land they don't use, families relocating, or investors who just want out without the typical real estate runaround.

**"How are you different from other land buyers?"**

> A lot of land buyers are faceless operations that blast out lowball offers. We're a real company built by real people—Mateo and Lisa started this in 2018 because they love land and hate unnecessary complexity. We make fair offers, we're transparent about our process, and we actually care about the outcome for the seller.

**"What's the story behind the name?"**

> We're roamers—always exploring, always looking for the next great piece of land. "Dirt Roamers" captures what we love: being connected to the land, traveling backroads, and finding value in places other people overlook.
