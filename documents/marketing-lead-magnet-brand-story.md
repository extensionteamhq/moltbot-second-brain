# Part 1: Understanding the Hero

*Every great story has a hero. In your brand story, that hero is your customer—not you.*

## Exercise 1.1: Define Your Hero

Who is your ideal customer? Get specific.

**Demographics:**
- Age range: _______________
- Location: _______________
- Income level: _______________
- Occupation/Industry: _______________

**Psychographics:**
- What do they value most? _______________
- What keeps them up at night? _______________

- What do they aspire to become? _______________

**Give your hero a name and face:**

Write a 2-3 sentence description of your ideal customer as if they were a real person:

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

---

## Exercise 1.2: What Does Your Hero Want?

Every hero wants something. What external desire drives your customer toward a solution like yours?

**The want should be:**
- Clear and specific
- Something they'd recognize immediately
- Related to what you offer

**Examples:**
- "I want to sell my land quickly for cash"
- "I want more qualified leads for my business"
- "I want to lose 20 pounds before my wedding"

**My hero wants:**

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

**Why do they want this? What will it give them?**

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

---

# Part 2: The Problem (Why Heroes Need Guides)

*Heroes don't go on journeys when everything is fine. Something has to be wrong.*

## Exercise 2.1: The Three Levels of Problems

Your customer's problem exists on three levels. Most businesses only address the first one—and that's why their marketing falls flat.

### Level 1: The External Problem
This is the obvious, tangible issue. It's what they'd tell a stranger at a party.

**What's the surface-level problem your customer faces?**

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

**Example:** "I inherited land I don't want and don't know what to do with it."

---

### Level 2: The Internal Problem
This is how the external problem makes them *feel*. This is where emotional connection happens.

**How does this problem make your customer feel?**

Check all that apply:
- [ ] Frustrated
- [ ] Overwhelmed
- [ ] Confused
- [ ] Embarrassed
- [ ] Anxious
- [ ] Stuck
- [ ] Incompetent
- [ ] Alone
- [ ] Hopeless
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Complete this sentence:**

"My customers are secretly frustrated because _________________________________"

"They feel ________________________ when they try to solve this on their own."

---

### Level 3: The Philosophical Problem
This is the "why it matters" level. It's about justice, fairness, and how things *should* be.

**Complete this sentence:**

"People shouldn't have to ________________________________________________"

"It's just not right that ________________________________________________"

**Example:** "It's not right that families get stuck paying taxes on land they never wanted and can't use."

---

## Exercise 2.2: The Villain

Every story has a villain—something causing the problem. This isn't a person; it's a force, condition, or frustration.

**What is the "villain" your customers are fighting against?**

- [ ] Complexity
- [ ] Time constraints  
- [ ] Bad information
- [ ] Broken systems
- [ ] Their own uncertainty
- [ ] Predatory competitors
- [ ] Red tape/bureaucracy
- [ ] Outdated methods
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Name your villain in one word or phrase:**

_____________________________________________________________________________

---

# Part 3: Enter the Guide (That's You)

*Heroes don't need another hero. They need a guide—someone who's been there and knows the way.*

## Exercise 3.1: Establishing Empathy

Before customers trust your competence, they need to know you understand them.

**Complete these empathy statements:**

"I know what it's like to ________________________________________________"

"I understand how frustrating it is when __________________________________"

"You shouldn't have to figure this out alone because _______________________"

**Write a 2-sentence empathy statement you could use in your marketing:**

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

---

## Exercise 3.2: Establishing Authority

Now they need to know you can actually help. Authority isn't bragging—it's proof.

**What gives you the right to guide them?**

Check what applies and add specifics:

- [ ] Years of experience: _______________
- [ ] Number of customers helped: _______________
- [ ] Credentials/Certifications: _______________
- [ ] Media features: _______________
- [ ] Testimonials/Reviews: _______________
- [ ] Personal experience with the problem: _______________
- [ ] Proprietary system/process: _______________
- [ ] Results/Statistics: _______________

**Write 2-3 "authority pieces" you can reference:**

1. _____________________________________________________________________________

2. _____________________________________________________________________________

3. _____________________________________________________________________________

---

## Exercise 3.3: Your One-Liner

A one-liner is a memorized statement that clearly explains what you do. It follows a simple formula.

**Formula:** [Problem] + [Solution] + [Result]

**Template:**
"Most [target customers] struggle with [problem]. We [solution], so they can [result]."

**Examples:**
- "Most land sellers wait months and lose money to agents. We make cash offers in 48 hours, so they can move on without the hassle."
- "Most small businesses struggle to get consistent leads. We build automated marketing systems, so they can grow without guessing."

**Write your one-liner:**

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

---

# Part 4: The Plan

*A confused customer never buys. Give them a simple path forward.*

## Exercise 4.1: Create Your Process Plan

People need to see clear, simple steps. This reduces mental friction.

**The magic number is 3-4 steps.**

**What are the simple steps a customer takes to work with you?**

| Step | Action | What Happens |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
| 4 | | |

**Example:**
1. Tell us about your property (simple form)
2. Get your cash offer (within 48 hours)
3. Choose your closing date (you're in control)
4. Get paid (fast, simple, done)

**Give your process a name (optional but powerful):**

"The _________________________ System/Process/Method"

---

## Exercise 4.2: Create an Agreement Plan

An agreement plan lists what you promise or what customers can expect. It addresses objections before they arise.

**What concerns might stop someone from working with you?**

1. _____________________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________________

**Now counter each with a promise or guarantee:**

1. _____________________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________________

**Example promises:**
- "No obligation—if our offer doesn't work for you, no hard feelings"
- "No hidden fees, ever"
- "We handle all the paperwork"

---

# Part 5: The Call to Action

*If you don't ask, you don't get. Be direct.*

## Exercise 5.1: Direct Call to Action

This is the main action you want customers to take. It should be clear, specific, and repeated often.

**What is the ONE main action you want customers to take?**

- [ ] Schedule a call
- [ ] Request a quote
- [ ] Buy now
- [ ] Start a free trial
- [ ] Get an assessment
- [ ] Submit their information
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Write your direct call to action as a button/headline:**

_____________________________________________________________________________

**Examples:** "Get Your Cash Offer" | "Schedule Your Free Strategy Call" | "Start Your Trial"

---

## Exercise 5.2: Transitional Calls to Action

Not everyone is ready to buy. Transitional CTAs let people engage at lower commitment.

**What can you offer that provides value while building trust?**

- [ ] Free guide/ebook
- [ ] Checklist
- [ ] Video training
- [ ] Newsletter
- [ ] Quiz/Assessment
- [ ] Free tool
- [ ] Webinar
- [ ] Case study
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Describe your transitional offer:**

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

**What's the CTA for this offer?**

_____________________________________________________________________________

# Part 6: The Stakes

*People move toward pleasure but run from pain. You need both.*

## Exercise 6.1: Define Success

Paint a vivid picture of life *after* working with you. What does transformation look like?

**Complete these sentences:**

"After working with us, my customers will feel _______________________________"

"They'll finally be able to ________________________________________________"

"Their life will be different because ______________________________________"

**List 3-5 specific positive outcomes:**

1. _____________________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________________
4. _____________________________________________________________________________
5. _____________________________________________________________________________

---

## Exercise 6.2: Define Failure

What happens if they DON'T solve this problem? What's at stake?

**Note:** You're not fear-mongering. You're being honest about consequences.

**Complete these sentences:**

"If they don't solve this, they'll continue to feel _________________________"

"Things will only get worse because ________________________________________"

"They might miss out on __________________________________________________"

"The cost of doing nothing is _____________________________________________"
