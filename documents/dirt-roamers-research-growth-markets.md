## Putting It Together — Analytical Framework

### Step 1: Identify Growth States
Use Census population estimates + IRS migration data to find states with net in-migration.

**Mateo's target states ranked by recent growth:**
1. **Florida** — Strong in-migration
2. **Georgia** — Atlanta metro growth
3. **Tennessee** — Nashville boom, no income tax
4. **North Carolina** — Charlotte, Raleigh growth
5. **South Carolina** — Coastal growth, low taxes
6. **Montana** — Lifestyle migration, limited but growing
7. **Alabama** — Slower but affordable

### Step 2: Drill to County Level
For each state, use Census county data to find:
- Fastest growing counties (population change)
- Net in-migration counties
- Counties adjacent to major metros

### Step 3: Validate with Housing Data
Cross-reference with Zillow/Redfin:
- Rising home values = demand
- Low inventory = constrained supply
- Short days on market = hot market

### Step 4: Check Economic Drivers
BLS/BEA data:
- Job growth
- Income growth
- Major employers moving in

### Step 5: Look for Infrastructure Signals
- New highway projects
- Utility expansions
- Commercial development permits
