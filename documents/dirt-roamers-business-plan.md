# Dirt Roamers — Business Plan & Execution Roadmap

*Last updated: 2026-02-02*

---

## Executive Summary

Dirt Roamers is a land acquisition and disposition business that flips vacant land for profit while building toward a long-term vision of creating self-sufficient homesteading communities. The business operates on two primary revenue streams:

1. **Land Flipping** — Buy low (cash or seller financing), sell higher (cash or seller financing)
2. **Dirt Roamers Resources** — Educational content + affiliate revenue helping others learn the land business

---

## Part 1: Land Flipping Operations

### 1.1 Target Criteria

**Property Profile:**
- 5-50 acres
- Larger parcels targeted for subdivision (5-10 acre lots)
- Just outside metro areas OR growing small towns
- Areas attractive to homesteaders and dream-home builders

**Seller Profile:**
- 40+ years old
- Owned 10+ years
- Inherited via probate
- Tax liens or foreclosure

**Target Markets:**
- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee

### 1.2 Acquisition Strategy

**Two-Offer Approach:**

| Offer Type | % of Market Value | Best For |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Cash | 40-50% | Quick closes, motivated sellers |
| Seller Financing | 80-90% | Lower out-of-pocket, terms-based sellers |

### 1.3 Disposition Strategy

| Buyer Type | Sale Price | Down Payment Required |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Cash/Financed Buyer | 80-95% MV | N/A (instant equity hook) |
| Seller Finance Buyer | 100-120% MV | 20-30% (covers acquisition debt) |

### 1.4 Lead Generation Stack

**Current Tools:**
- [x] landinsights.co — Sourcing + skip tracing (limited plan)
- [x] land.id — Supplemental property data
- [x] Zillow — Manual research

**Under Consideration:**
- [ ] landportal.com — TBD (needs research)
- [ ] landai.ai — AI cold calling (expensive but interesting)

**Outreach Methods (Priority Order):**
1. Cold calling (VA or AI)
2. SMS/Text campaigns
3. Email sequences
4. Direct mail (lowest priority — expensive, low ROI)

**CRM:** GoHighLevel (planned)
- Calls, texts, emails
- Newsletters
- Booking/scheduling
- Pipeline management

### 1.5 Operations Workflow

```
[Data Source] → [Skip Trace] → [Multi-Touch Outreach] → [Conversation] → [Two Offers] → [Contract] → [Close] → [Disposition]
```

## Part 2: Long-Term Vision — Homesteading Community

### 2.1 Concept

Acquire larger parcels (50+ acres), subdivide into 5-10 acre lots, and create intentional homesteading communities where:

- Families live self-sufficiently
- Responsibilities are shared (livestock, crops, maintenance)
- Everyone can take vacations without losing progress
- Community generates collective revenue

### 2.2 Revenue Streams

| Stream | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Seller Financing | Cash flow from lot sales |
| Produce | Vegetables, fruits, herbs |
| Protein | Eggs, dairy, meat (chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, cattle) |
| Specialty | Honey, flowers |
| Agritourism | Hunting leases, camping, RV sites |
