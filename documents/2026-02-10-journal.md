  - Cal.com meeting confirmations (Philip Robinson on Tuesday, Jonny Brush on Wednesday)
  - Jamil Damji sent comping video resource
  - HighLevel Affiliate Community tag notification
  - BTB Slack mention from Kathryn Carlson
- Unread count fluctuated between 17-201 throughout the day

### Dirt Roamers Research

- Created closing options guide for land transactions
- Research covers: zoning, title verification, taxes, topography, flood zones, access, utilities, perc tests, environmental issues, HOA restrictions, boundaries, and comps
- Closing guide covers self-closing vs title company vs hybrid approaches
- State-by-state requirements documented for Mateo's target markets (AL, FL, GA, MT, NC, SC, TN)

### Accountability
- Sent evening check-in at 6 PM Eastern asking about workout and morning reading
- Sent OC Wednesday Accountability Prep at 7 PM Eastern for tomorrow's 8:45 AM call

## Decisions Made

- Continued email monitoring through February 15, 2026 (observation period)
- Research files saved to `/projects/dirt-roamers/research/` and summary updated
- No responses received from Mateo on task recommendations (1: AI cold calling research, 2: Affiliate content outline)

## Action Items

- [ ] Follow up on Janet R's Georgia property inquiry (potential deal)
- [ ] Mateo to fill in OC Wednesday Accountability prep answers before tomorrow's call
- [ ] Consider updating Kanban with approved tasks when Mateo responds

## Key Insights

1. **Email patterns**: Cal.com notifications are frequent (3 in one day) — meeting scheduling is active
2. **Due diligence is critical**: The 30-60 minutes spent on checks can save thousands on bad land deals
3. **Closing costs matter**: For properties under $5K, self-closing saves profit margins; over $15K, title company protection is worth it
4. **State requirements vary**: NC and SC require attorneys for closings, while AL, FL, MT, TN allow title company closings

## Summary

A productive background day focused on research and routine check-ins. Completed two major research documents for Dirt Roamers (due diligence checklist and closing options guide) that will support Mateo's land flipping operations. Maintained monitoring of email inbox and sent scheduled accountability messages. No direct interaction with Mateo today — all tasks were cron-based automated work.
