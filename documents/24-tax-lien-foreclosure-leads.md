# Tax Lien & Foreclosure Lead Sourcing Guide

**Created:** 2026-02-22  
**Purpose:** Source motivated land sellers facing tax liens or foreclosure  
**Target States:** AL, FL, GA, MT, NC, SC, TN

---

## Overview

Tax-distressed property owners are highly motivated sellers—they need to sell or risk losing their land. This guide covers how to find tax lien and pre-foreclosure leads for vacant land, complementing the probate lead sourcing strategy.

### Why These Leads Work for Land

- **High motivation:** Owners facing property loss have urgency
- **Often vacant land:** Property taxes on unused land feel "wasteful" to owners
- **Lower competition:** Most investors focus on houses, not land
- **Clear value proposition:** "Get cash now vs. lose it to the county"

## Tax Lien vs Tax Deed States

Understanding your target state's system determines your approach:

### Tax Lien States (Buy the Lien)
- **Montana** - Tax lien state
- Interest rate: Up to 10% annually
- Redemption period: 3 years

### Tax Deed States (Buy the Property)
- **Alabama** - Tax deed (3-year redemption right)
- **Florida** - Tax deed (no redemption after sale)
- **Georgia** - Tax deed (1-year redemption right)
- **North Carolina** - Tax deed (limited redemption)
- **South Carolina** - Tax deed (1-year redemption)
- **Tennessee** - Tax deed (1-year redemption)

### Strategic Implication

In **tax deed states**, you can either:
1. Buy tax-delinquent land directly at auction (acquire at discount)
2. Contact delinquent owners BEFORE auction to buy directly (seller deal)

In **tax lien states** (Montana):
- Focus on pre-lien outreach to distressed owners
- Or buy liens and wait for redemption/foreclosure

## Pre-Auction Outreach Strategy

### Timeline (Tax Deed States)

| Timeline | Owner Mindset | Approach |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| 2+ years delinquent | May not realize severity | Educational outreach |
| 1-2 years delinquent | Aware, possibly overwhelmed | Cash offer, urgency building |
| 6 months to auction | Stressed, seeking solutions | Strong urgency, immediate help |
| 30-60 days to auction | Desperate | Highest conversion, needs speed |

### Messaging Framework

**Initial Outreach:**
> "I noticed your property at [address] may have outstanding taxes. I specialize in buying land quickly for cash and can often help property owners in this situation. Would you be open to a conversation?"

**Follow-Up (Closer to Auction):**
> "I want to make sure you're aware that your property at [address] is scheduled for tax sale on [date]. I'm still interested in making a fair cash offer—this could be simpler than going through the auction process. Can we talk this week?"

**Final Push (Last 30 Days):**
> "The tax sale for your property is coming up on [date]. I can close quickly and help you walk away with cash instead of losing the property entirely. I'm available to discuss this week."

### Key Points for Tax-Distressed Sellers

1. **You get cash vs. nothing** - At auction, they lose the property and get nothing (except possible surplus)
2. **Avoid the embarrassment** - Public auction, their name in records
3. **Handle it privately** - Discreet transaction
4. **Fast timeline** - Can close in 2 weeks
5. **No fees or commissions** - Direct buyer

## Offer Strategy for Tax-Distressed Land

### Pricing Considerations

- **Know the tax owed:** This is your floor—seller needs enough to clear liens
- **Know auction timing:** Closer to auction = more leverage
- **Know market value:** Still use standard comps process

### Example Scenario

| Factor | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Market Value | $50,000 |
| Back Taxes Owed | $4,000 |
| Your Target Offer | $20,000-25,000 |
| Why It Works | Seller walks with $16,000-21,000 vs. nothing |

### Two-Offer Approach (Same as Standard Dirt Roamers)

1. **Cash Offer:** 40-50% of market value (must cover taxes + seller profit)
2. **Seller Finance Offer:** 80-90% of market value (if seller wants more, terms work)

---

## Tax Lien Auction Strategy (Direct Acquisition)

### When to Buy at Auction vs. Before

**Buy at Auction When:**
- No response to pre-auction outreach
- Property is highly desirable
- Expected auction price still profitable
- Want to avoid negotiation

**Buy Before Auction When:**
- Owner is responsive
- Can get better price than auction competition
- Need quick flip
- Property has title issues you want seller to clear

### Auction Due Diligence

Before bidding:
1. **Title search** - Check for other liens that survive auction
2. **Physical inspection** - Drive by minimum, survey if possible
3. **Zoning/restrictions** - Confirm intended use is allowed
4. **Access** - Verify legal road access
5. **Environmental** - Wetlands, flood zones, contamination
6. **Comps** - Know your max bid based on ARV

### Auction Bidding Tips

- **Set max bid BEFORE auction** - Don't get emotional
- **Factor all costs** - Recording fees, title insurance, holding costs
- **Watch for surplus overbid rules** - Excess goes to former owner, not you
- **Start low** - Many auctions have no bidders for land parcels
