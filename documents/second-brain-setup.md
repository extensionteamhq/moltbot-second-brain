# Second Brain Setup Complete 🧠

This document was auto-generated by Molly to confirm the deployment pipeline is working.

## What's Connected

- ✅ **GitHub Repo**: extensionteamhq/moltbot-second-brain
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Auto-deploys on push
- ✅ **Deploy Key**: Molly can push updates without manual tokens
- ✅ **Daily Journal Cron**: Runs at 10 PM Eastern

## How It Works

1. Molly generates journal entries from our daily conversations
2. New `.md` files are committed to the `documents/` folder
3. Push triggers Vercel auto-deploy
4. Second Brain UI updates within ~60 seconds

## Next Steps

- Add more document types (newsletters, scripts, ideas)
