# Land AI Research Update — March 1, 2026

## Pricing Status

**Pricing remains NOT publicly available.** 

Key findings:
- Land AI offers 50-lead, 100-lead, and 200-lead plans
- Month-to-month commitment (no long-term contract)
- No setup or onboarding fees
- Discounts available for 3, 6, or 12-month prepayment
- All-inclusive: data ingestion, DNC scrubbing, calling, AI qualification, human QA, comp reports, CRM routing

**Recommendation:** Book a discovery call to get actual pricing. Based on the service level (human-dialed handoff + AI + 100% human QA + compliance handling), expect premium pricing — likely $500+/month minimum for 100-lead plan.

## Updated Feature Notes (March 2026)

### Performance Claims (Current)
| Metric | Traditional Cold Calling | Land AI |
|--------|-------------------------|---------|
| Deals per 100 leads | ~1 | ~5 (1 per 20 qualified) |
| Time investment | 80+ hours | ~20% of that |
| Qualified leads delivered | Unknown | ~20-30 per 100 |
| Close rate on hot leads | ~1% | ~5% (1 in 20) |

### Compliance (Confirmed)
- ✅ TCPA compliant (human-dialed → AI transfer structure)
- ✅ All 50 states covered
- ✅ State registrations and bond filings maintained
- ✅ Passed state-level compliance reviews (including Texas)
- ✅ Internal Do-Not-Call registry
- ✅ Audit logs for legal protection
- ✅ 100% human QA on every call before CRM delivery

### Integration
- GoHighLevel ✅
- HubSpot ✅
- REI Conversion ✅
- InvestorFuse ✅
- Custom CRMs via webhook ✅

## Affiliate Program

**Status: Not found** — Land AI does not publicly advertise an affiliate program. Would need to inquire directly if interested.

## Comparison to DIY Alternatives

| Factor | Land AI | DIY (VA + Dialer) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Monthly cost | $500+ (est.) | $200-400 | VA $15-25/hr + dialer $50/mo |
| Time required | Low | Medium | VA management overhead |
| Control | Low | High | Land AI runs everything |
| Compliance | Handled | You manage | Land AI handles TCPA/state |
| Scalability | Easy | Moderate | VA hiring/scaling takes effort |

## Recommendation (Unchanged from February)

**Phase 4+ consideration** — After:
- GoHighLevel CRM is set up and running
- Lead generation is dialed in with consistent leads
- You have data on current cost-per-deal to compare

Land AI is compelling for operators who:
- Have capital but limited time
- Hate cold calling or managing VAs
- Want predictable, scalable acquisitions
- Already processing 50+ leads/month

Not recommended for:
- Tight budget operators
- Those wanting full conversation control
- Small lead volumes (under 50/month)
