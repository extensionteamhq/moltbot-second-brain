# Rank-n-Soar — Expansion Ideas

## Current Model
Buy domain → Clone Payload CMS template → SEO + LLM SEO → Generate leads → Sell to local service providers

## Expansion Opportunities

### 1. Industry Vertical Packages
Pre-built templates for high-value niches:
- **Roofing** — Storm damage, emergency repairs
- **HVAC** — Seasonal demand (summer AC, winter heating)
- **Plumbing** — Emergency services, high intent
- **Landscaping** — Recurring revenue potential
- **Garage Doors** — Underserved, high ticket

### 2. Geographic Clustering
Instead of one-off cities, dominate a metro:
- Dallas-Fort Worth (12+ suburbs)
- Atlanta Metro (15+ suburbs)
- Tampa Bay Area (8+ cities)

*Economies of scale: same content templates, local variations*

### 3. LLM SEO Playbook
- Train custom GPTs with local business info
- Create "Answer Engine Optimization" content
- Target AI-generated search results (Perplexity, SearchGPT)

### 4. Partnership Model
- Find local SEO agencies
- White-label the sites
- They handle client relationships, we handle tech

## Revenue Projections

| Model | Sites | MRR/Site | Monthly |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Current | 5 | $300 | $1,500 |
| Expanded | 20 | $300 | $6,000 |
| Agency | 50 | $200 | $10,000 |

## Next Steps
1. Build 3 industry templates (roofing, HVAC, plumbing)
2. Test geographic clustering in Tampa market
3. Document LLM SEO results for case study
