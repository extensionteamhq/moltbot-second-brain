# Land Wholesaling & JV Partnership Strategies

*Research Date: February 19, 2026*

---

## Overview

Land wholesaling is a capital-light strategy for generating income from land deals without needing to purchase property outright. Combined with Joint Venture (JV) partnerships, these strategies allow land investors to scale quickly, take on larger deals, and minimize risk.

This guide covers:
- Assignment vs. double close strategies
- JV partnership structures
- Legal requirements and best practices
- When to wholesale vs. hold
- Building a buyer network

---

## Part 1: Land Wholesaling Fundamentals

### What is Land Wholesaling?

Land wholesaling involves:
1. **Finding** undervalued land from motivated sellers
2. **Contracting** the property at a discounted price
3. **Assigning** that contract to an end buyer for a profit (assignment fee)

You never take ownership. You're the matchmaker between motivated sellers and cash buyers.

### Why Wholesale Land vs. Houses?

| Factor | Land Wholesaling | House Wholesaling |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Competition | Lower | Very high |
| Emotional sellers | Less emotional | Highly emotional |
| Due diligence | Simpler (no inspections) | Complex |
| Title issues | Less common | More common |
| Buyer pool | Smaller but eager | Large but picky |
| Typical spread | $2K–$25K | $5K–$20K |
| Holding costs | Minimal (no utilities) | High |

**Key insight:** Land is less competitive and more forgiving for beginners.

## Part 2: Two Exit Strategies

### Option A: Assignment of Contract

**How it works:**
1. Sign a Purchase & Sale Agreement (PSA) with seller
2. Include an "and/or assigns" clause in the contract
3. Find an end buyer willing to pay more
4. Assign your contract rights to the buyer for a fee
5. Buyer closes directly with seller; you collect your fee at closing

**Pros:**
- No money needed beyond earnest money deposit
- Never take title (no closing costs on your end)
- Fastest way to get paid

**Cons:**
- Spread visible to all parties (seller sees your profit)
- Some sellers/title companies don't allow assignments
- Limited to smaller spreads (large markups look bad)

**Best for:** Deals with $2K–$10K spreads, cooperative sellers

### Option B: Double Close (Simultaneous Close)

**How it works:**
1. Sign PSA with seller (A→B transaction)
2. Find end buyer at higher price (B→C transaction)
3. Close BOTH transactions same day, often within hours
4. Title company uses buyer's funds to fund your purchase
5. You briefly own the property (minutes to hours)

**Pros:**
- Seller never sees your profit
- Works for larger spreads ($10K–$50K+)
- More professional appearance

**Cons:**
- Need title company that handles double closes
- May need transactional funding if timing doesn't align
- Slightly more complex paperwork
- You briefly hold title (small risk window)

**Best for:** Deals with spreads >$10K, sellers who might object to assignment fees

### Transactional Funding

If the A→B closing needs to fund before B→C closes:
- **Transactional lenders** provide 24-hour to 7-day loans
- Typical cost: 1–2% of loan amount
- No credit check, funded same/next day
- Only use if double close timing doesn't align

**Transactional funding sources:**
- BestTransactionFunding.com
- TransactionalFundingSolutions.com
- Local hard money lenders

## Part 3: Essential Contracts

### 1. Purchase & Sale Agreement (PSA)

Your contract with the seller must include:

**Critical clauses:**
- **"And/or assigns"** after your name as buyer
- **Inspection period** (10–30 days) for due diligence and finding buyer
- **Earnest money** terms (refundable during inspection)
- **Clear closing date** with extension option
- **Title contingency** (deal void if title issues found)

**Sample buyer name line:**
> "Dirt Roamers LLC, and/or assigns"

### 2. Assignment Agreement

Used to transfer your PSA rights to the end buyer:

**Must include:**
- Original contract reference
- Assignment fee amount
- Payment terms (due at closing)
- Responsibilities transfer

**Sample clause:**
> "Assignor hereby assigns all rights, title, and interest in the Purchase Agreement dated [DATE] for property [ADDRESS/APN] to Assignee for an assignment fee of $[AMOUNT], payable at closing."

### 3. Disclosure Forms

Depending on state, you may need to disclose:
- That you're assigning (not the actual owner)
- Your role as principal buyer, not agent
- Your profit/assignment fee

**Best practice:** Be transparent. Say "I'm an investor who contracts properties and sells my purchase rights."

## Part 4: Finding Motivated Sellers

### Seller Motivation Indicators

Target landowners who:
- Own 10+ years (tired landlords)
- Live out of state (absentee owners)
- Inherited property (probate)
- Behind on taxes (tax delinquent)
- In foreclosure
- Own multiple parcels (overwhelmed)
- Are elderly (simplifying estates)

### Lead Sources for Wholesaling

| Source | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| County tax delinquent lists | Free–$50 | High motivation |
| Probate records | Free–$100 | Time-sensitive sellers |
| Land Portal / PropStream | $60–$500/mo | Filtered data + skip trace |
| Driving for dollars | Gas money | Find forgotten parcels |
| Facebook/Craigslist ads | $5–$20/day | Inbound leads |
| Direct mail | $0.50–$1/piece | 0.5–2% response rate |
| Cold calling/SMS | $0.05–$0.15/contact | 1–3% engagement |

### Outreach Script (Initial Contact)

> "Hi [NAME], I'm calling about your property on [ROAD/COUNTY]. I'm a local land investor, and I'm reaching out to landowners to see if you'd consider selling. Is this something you'd be open to discussing?"

**If yes:** Gather motivation, timeline, price expectations.
**If no:** "No problem! If anything changes, I'd love to chat. Have a great day."

## Part 5: Building Your Buyer Network

### Where to Find Cash Buyers

**Active Marketing:**

## Part 6: Joint Venture Partnerships

### When to JV

Consider a JV when:
- Deal is too large for your capital
- You lack expertise in the market/exit strategy
- You want to share risk on complex deals
- Partner brings buyers/marketing you don't have
- Learning opportunity with experienced investor

### JV Structure Options

#### 1. Capital Partner + Operator Model

**You (Operator) bring:**
- Deal sourcing
- Seller negotiation
- Due diligence
- Transaction management

**Partner brings:**
- Purchase capital
- Holding costs
- Marketing budget

**Typical split:** 50/50 of net profit

#### 2. Deal Sourcer + Buyer Model

**You bring:**
- Contracted deal
- Seller relationship

**Partner brings:**
- Closing funds
- Disposition

**Typical split:** 30–50% to deal sourcer, 50–70% to buyer

#### 3. Marketing Partner Model

**You bring:**
- Contracted deal
- Purchase funds

**Partner brings:**
- Buyer list
- Marketing expertise
- Sales closing

**Typical split:** 60–70% you, 30–40% marketing partner

### JV Agreement Essentials

A JV agreement should include:

1. **Parties:** Legal names and entities
2. **Property:** Specific parcel(s) covered
3. **Contributions:** Who provides what (capital, services)
4. **Profit split:** Percentage breakdown
5. **Decision rights:** Who has final say
6. **Timeline:** Expected hold period
7. **Exit strategy:** How and when to sell
8. **Expense handling:** Who pays what, reimbursements
9. **Dispute resolution:** Mediation/arbitration clause
10. **Dissolution:** What happens if deal falls through

**Pro tip:** Use a real estate attorney to draft or review JV agreements. A few hundred dollars prevents thousands in disputes.

### Red Flags in JV Partners

⚠️ Avoid partners who:
- Won't put agreements in writing
- Have no track record or references
- Promise unrealistic returns
- Want control without contribution
- Have pending lawsuits or liens

## Part 7: Pricing Your Wholesale Deal

### The Wholesale Spread Formula

```
Seller Contract Price + Your Assignment Fee = Buyer Price

Example:
$15,000 (seller) + $5,000 (your fee) = $20,000 (to buyer)
```

### Pricing Guidelines

| Parcel Value | Typical Assignment Fee |
|--------------|------------------------|
| $5K–$15K | $1,500–$3,000 |
| $15K–$50K | $3,000–$7,500 |
| $50K–$100K | $7,500–$15,000 |
| $100K+ | $15,000–$25,000+ |

**Rule of thumb:** Your spread should leave room for the buyer to profit too. If ARV is $50K and you're selling at $45K, buyer won't bite.

### Quick Comp Analysis

Before making an offer:
1. Check MLS sold data (Land Portal, Redfin, Zillow)
2. Look for similar size, location, access within 6 months
3. Price per acre comparisons
4. Adjust for differences (road access, utilities, buildability)

**Target:** Contract at 40–60% of conservative ARV, sell at 70–85%.

## Part 8: Legal Considerations by State

### States with Wholesaling Restrictions

While land wholesaling is generally legal, some states have tightened rules:

| State | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Illinois | Requires disclosure of assignment intent |
| Oklahoma | Marketing restrictions for non-owners |
| Ohio | Increased scrutiny on unlicensed activity |
| Pennsylvania | May require license for repeated transactions |

### Best Practices for Compliance

1. **Never represent yourself as the owner** if you haven't closed
2. **Disclose your investor/wholesaler status** upfront
3. **Market the contract, not the property** ("contract for sale")
4. **Use proper legal documents** reviewed by an attorney
5. **Keep records** of all communications
6. **Work with investor-friendly title companies**
7. **Consult a local RE attorney** when entering new markets

## Part 9: Dirt Roamers Application

### Wholesaling for Capital Generation

Given Mateo's goal of generating capital through land flips:

**Immediate opportunities:**
1. Wholesale deals where purchase capital isn't available
2. Quickly monetize leads that don't fit the buy-hold criteria
3. Test new markets with minimal risk

**Recommended approach:**
- Use assignments for deals <$10K spread
- Use double close for larger spreads
- Build buyer list alongside acquisition marketing
- JV with capital partners on larger parcels

### Integration with Current Strategy

| Current Strategy | Wholesaling Integration |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Direct-to-seller outreach | Same leads can be wholesaled or purchased |
| 40–50% cash offers | Perfect for wholesaling with 10–20% markup |
| Seller financing offers | Keep these; wholesale the pure cash deals |
| GoHighLevel CRM | Add wholesale buyer pipeline |

### Recommended First Steps

1. **Add assignability clause** to current PSA template
2. **Create assignment agreement** template
3. **Start building buyer list** (20–50 buyers before first wholesale)
4. **Identify 2–3 investor-friendly title companies** in target states
5. **Set aside 1–2 deals/month** for wholesale practice
