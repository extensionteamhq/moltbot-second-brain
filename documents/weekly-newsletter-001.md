# Dirt Roamers Newsletter #001

**Subject Line**: What I learned from 100 cold calls to landowners

## The Hook

Last week I made 100 cold calls to landowners in Alabama. Here's what actually happened...

## Main Content

### The Numbers
- 100 calls made
- 23 conversations
- 8 interested sellers
- 2 deals in negotiation

### What Worked
- Calling between 10am-2pm got 3x more pickups
- Leading with "I saw you own land in [county]" instead of "I'm looking to buy land"
- Asking about their situation first

### What Didn't Work
- Evenings (people are tired, suspicious)
- Scripted pitches (too salesy)
- Pushing for commitment on first call

## The Lesson

Cold calling isn't about the sale. It's about starting a conversation. Most sellers aren't ready today, but they remember you when they are.

## CTA

Reply and tell me: what's your biggest challenge with seller outreach?
