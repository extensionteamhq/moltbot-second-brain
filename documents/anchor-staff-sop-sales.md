# SOP: Sales Process
## Anchor & Staff Agency

### Purpose
Convert qualified leads into clients through a consultative, value-driven sales process.

---

## 1. Sales Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Consultative, not pushy** — We're advisors, not salespeople
- **Qualify early** — Not every lead is a fit
- **Value first** — Demonstrate expertise before asking for commitment
- **Clear pricing** — No hidden fees or surprises
- **Right fit focus** — Better to say no than take a bad client

---

## 2. Lead Qualification

### Ideal Client Criteria
- **Budget:** Can invest $5K+ in strategic services
- **Authority:** Decision-maker or has access to one
- **Need:** Clear pain point we can solve
- **Timeline:** Ready to start within 30-60 days
- **Fit:** Values align, good communication

### Disqualification Signs
- Looking for cheapest option
- Wants tactics without strategy
- Unclear on their own business goals
- History of churning through agencies
- Disrespectful or demanding in early interactions

## 3. Sales Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Lead (New Inquiry)
- Source: Website form, referral, outbound
- Action: Review inquiry within 24 hours
- Next: Schedule discovery call or disqualify

### Stage 2: Discovery Call Scheduled
- Duration: 30-45 minutes
- Goal: Understand their situation, qualify fit
- Outcome: Move to proposal or politely decline

### Stage 3: Proposal Sent
- Timeline: Within 48 hours of discovery call
- Include: Scope, timeline, investment, next steps
- Follow-up: 3-day and 7-day if no response

### Stage 4: Negotiation
- Address questions/concerns
- Adjust scope if needed (not price without scope change)
- Set decision deadline

### Stage 5: Closed Won / Closed Lost
- Won: Send contract, collect deposit, begin onboarding
- Lost: Log reason, add to nurture sequence

## 6. Handling Objections

### "It's too expensive"
- "I understand budget is a concern. Can you help me understand what you were expecting to invest?"
- Reframe as ROI: "If this generated $X in revenue, would that be worth the investment?"
- Option: Adjust scope, not price

### "I need to think about it"
- "Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?"
- Address concerns directly
- Set specific follow-up: "Can I check back Thursday?"

### "We're talking to other agencies"
- "That makes sense. What criteria are you using to decide?"
- Differentiate on approach, not price
- "What would make you choose us over others?"

### "Can you send more information?"
- "Happy to. What specific questions do you have?"
- Don't email and disappear — get commitment to next conversation
