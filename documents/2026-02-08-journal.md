# Daily Journal - February 8, 2026 (Sunday)

## Topics Discussed

### Dirt Roamers Research Completion
- Confirmed all 5 original research topics were completed on Feb 6
- Created new research document: `07-land-listing-platforms.md` — comprehensive guide to disposition platforms
- Key finding: Land.com Network (LandWatch, Lands of America, Land And Farm) is the core stack for selling land
- Facebook Marketplace + Craigslist provide free supplemental reach
- Listing asset quality (photos, maps, disclosures) matters more than platform choice
- No notable affiliate programs for disposition platforms — affiliate efforts should focus on acquisition tools

### Google API Credentials Documentation
- Mateo flagged that I keep forgetting about working Google credentials
- Documented the credentials in both TOOLS.md and MEMORY.md
- Location: `~/.clawdbot/google-calendar-credentials.json`
- Access includes Gmail (full read/search/draft/send) and all 4 calendars

## Decisions Made

1. **Research phase complete** — Dirt Roamers research is essentially done. Ready for execution phase.
2. **Credential awareness** — Established clear rule: If Mateo asks me to check email, send email, check calendar, or create appointments — JUST DO IT. Don't claim I need authentication setup.

## Action Items

### For Mateo
1. Set up GoHighLevel for Dirt Roamers CRM
2. Pick first target county for land acquisition
3. Start Land Portal trial
4. Pull first list and begin outreach

### For Molly
- ✅ Updated TOOLS.md with Google API documentation
- ✅ Updated MEMORY.md with Google API reminder
- ✅ Created land listing platforms research document

## Key Insights

- **Disposition platforms don't have strong affiliate programs** — This is valuable info for the Dirt Roamers Resources arm. Focus affiliate revenue opportunities on acquisition tools (Land Portal, LandAI, skip tracing services, GoHighLevel) rather than listing platforms.

- **Asset quality > platform choice** — When selling land, the quality of the listing (photos, maps, proper disclosures) matters more than which platform is used. This means standardizing the listing creation process will have higher ROI than platform arbitrage.

- **Calendar integration gap identified** — Morning cron job revealed gcalcli isn't installed/authenticated. However, I have working Google API credentials that can be used programmatically via googleapis library instead.

## Summary

Quiet Sunday focused on wrapping up Dirt Roamers research and documentation. The research phase is now complete — 7 comprehensive documents covering acquisition tools (Land Portal, LandAI, skip tracing alternatives), county records, growth markets, GoHighLevel CRM, and now disposition platforms. 

The most impactful learning was the explicit documentation of Google API credentials. This should prevent future confusion about authentication status when Mateo requests email or calendar actions.

Next phase for Dirt Roamers is pure execution: GoHighLevel setup → target county selection → Land Portal trial → first outreach campaign.
