### Dirt Roamers — Detailed Strategy

**Target Properties:**
- 5-50 acres (larger parcels for subdivision into 5-10 acre lots)
- Just outside metro areas OR small towns with growth/people moving in
- Areas where people want to build dream homes or homesteads

**Target Sellers:**
- 40+ years old
- Owned land 10+ years
- Inherited via probate
- Tax liens or foreclosure situations

**Acquisition Offers (Two-Option Strategy):**
1. **Cash offer:** 40-50% of market value
2. **Seller financing:** 80-90% of market value (if terms work)

**Exit Strategy:**
- Cash/financed buyers: List at 80-95% market value (instant equity for buyer)
- Seller financing to buyer: 100-120% market value (cash flow play)
- Require 20-30% down from buyer to pay off/reduce acquisition debt

**Long-Term Vision — Homesteading Community:**
- Buy larger parcels, subdivide, place homesteaders on lots
- Self-sufficient community: grow food, raise livestock (chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, cattle)
- Shared responsibilities — families can vacation while others cover
- Revenue streams: seller financing cash flow, produce/eggs/dairy/meat sales, flowers, honey, agritourism (hunting, camping, RV parks)
- Secondary business model after enough flips generate capital (or acquire on seller financing)
