### Dirt Roamers — Detailed Strategy

**Target Properties:**
- 5-50 acres (larger parcels for subdivision into 5-10 acre lots)
- Just outside metro areas OR small towns with growth/people moving in
- Areas where people want to build dream homes or homesteads

**Target Sellers:**
- 40+ years old
- Owned land 10+ years
- Inherited via probate
- Tax liens or foreclosure situations

**Acquisition Offers (Two-Option Strategy):**
1. **Cash offer:** 40-50% of market value
2. **Seller financing:** 80-90% of market value (if terms work)

**Exit Strategy:**
- Cash/financed buyers: List at 80-95% market value (instant equity for buyer)
- Seller financing to buyer: 100-120% market value (cash flow play)
- Require 20-30% down from buyer to pay off/reduce acquisition debt

**Long-Term Vision — Homesteading Community:**
- Buy larger parcels, subdivide, place homesteaders on lots
- Self-sufficient community: grow food, raise livestock (chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, cattle)
- Shared responsibilities — families can vacation while others cover
- Revenue streams: seller financing cash flow, produce/eggs/dairy/meat sales, flowers, honey, agritourism (hunting, camping, RV parks)
- Secondary business model after enough flips generate capital (or acquire on seller financing)

**Lead Generation Needs:**
- Data sources for finding land (analytical — areas likely to sell)
- Skip tracing owners (phone, email)
- Pulling deeds/mortgages from county records, scraping owner details
- Multi-touch outreach: calling, texting, email (cheaper than direct mail which had limited success)
- Eventually: AI cold calling

**Current Tools:**
- landinsights.co — sourcing + skip tracing (recently downgraded, limited)
- land.id — supplemental property info
- Zillow + Joe McCall's Dirt Flippers training/strategies

**Tools Under Consideration:**
- landportal.com
- landai.ai — AI cold calling/voice agent (pricey)

**Tech Stack (Planned):**
- GoHighLevel as CRM — calls, texts, emails, newsletters, booking

**Dirt Roamers Resources (Educational Arm):**
- Model after Joe McCall's Dirt Flippers brand
- Build educational materials for aspiring land flippers
- Affiliate programs from tools: land.id, landportal, landai, GoHighLevel (waiting on landinsights)
- Pair affiliate recommendations with bonuses: guides, consultations, GHL snapshots
- Content channels: blog, social media, newsletters
- Revenue: affiliate commissions + digital products

### Mission
- Build and buy businesses + acquire real estate
- "Mt. Everest" goal (details TBD)
- Needs more active income to fund the vision

### Projects in Progress
- **Books (2):**
  1. Affiliate marketing income generation
  2. Personal branding — build your brand, promote yourself, earn affiliate income + sell your own products/services
- **Bootcamp/Workshop:** With Owner's Club group — teaching how to build/promote/launch bootcamps for personal branding
- **Rank N Soar:** Rank and rent model — template site built with Payload CMS (Next.js). Buy domain → clone template → SEO + LLM SEO → generate leads → sell to local service providers. Needs research on localized service-based industries.
- **Consulting Agency:** Anchor & Staff (anchorandstaff.com) — with Mike Davis (partner) and Cheryl Trosky (brand strategy). Full-service marketing agency helping small businesses build their brand, understand their target market, and build marketing channels to generate leads/revenue. Positioning: "Your marketing department & premium strategist."
- **Partner With Mateo Resources:** Adding affiliate resources (SubTo, Gator, Top-Tier TC signups) — "what you get", "why sign up", workbooks, guides, worksheets, how-tos, GoHighLevel snapshots, data source links. Affiliate revenue + helping people succeed.
- **Dirt Roamers Resources:** Affiliate content + digital products to help land owners sell and new investors get started. Model: Joe McCall's Dirt Flippers program — affiliate income from tools/resources.
- **Personal Brand / Social Media:** Building presence on Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, eventually YouTube. Planning to use AI avatar (Blotato) for short-form video content. Challenge: struggles with on-camera recording, finding words, clarity in unscripted speaking.
