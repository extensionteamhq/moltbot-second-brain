## Overview

This document covers new and updated land data platforms as of February 2026, with focus on features, pricing, and fit for Dirt Roamers' lead generation strategy.

## Acres.com

### Overview
Acres.com is a comprehensive land data and mapping platform covering 150+ million parcels nationwide. They've recently added skip tracing capabilities and AI-powered search features.

### Features
- **Parcel Data:** Boundaries, owner names, addresses, property characteristics
- **Mapping:** Customizable maps with 100+ recreational layers
- **AI Search:** Native AI search and zoning intelligence
- **Skip Tracing:** New feature (as of February 2026) — direct owner contact info

### Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Pricing | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Basic** | ~$29-49/mo | Individual investors, basic parcel lookup |
| **Premium/Plus** | ~$99-119/mo | Most users — AI features + lead lists |
| **Enterprise** | $650+/mo | Teams, unlimited everything |

*Note: Exact pricing requires visiting acres.com/pricing or starting free trial*

### Pros
- 150+ million parcel database
- New AI search features (added Feb 2026)
- Skip tracing now integrated
- Strong mapping and visualization tools
- Good for market analysis and comps

### Cons
- Skip tracing is new — untested hit rates
- Pricing can add up for advanced features
- No established affiliate program mentioned

### Affiliate Potential
Unknown if Acres offers an affiliate program. Would need to contact their team.

### Verdict for Dirt Roamers
**Consider in Phase 2.** Land Portal is currently recommended for its established skip tracing and 30% affiliate program. Acres could be a backup or alternative if Land Portal doesn't meet needs.

## Land App (thelandapp.com)

### Overview
The Land App is a UK-focused platform (not to be confused with U.S. land investing). Not recommended for Dirt Roamers' U.S.-focused strategy.
